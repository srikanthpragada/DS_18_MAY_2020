The room was kind of clean but had a VERY strong smell of dogs. Generally below average but ok for a overnight stay if you're not too fussy. Would consider staying again if the price was right. Breakfast was free and just about better than nothing.,not happy
"I stayed at the Crown Plaza April -- - April --, ----. The staff was friendly and attentive. The elevators are tiny (about -' by -'). The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving! I would stay here again for business, but would not come here on vacation.",not happy
"I booked this hotel through Hotwire at the lowest price I could find. When we got there the front desk manager gave us a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""smoking"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room. I argued that I have a little baby and I would not have booked the room had I known it was smoking. The manager would not hear anything further and told me that Hotwire books the cheapest rooms that are available. So, from the get go I was very unhappy.
After a great deal of persuasion and discussion, I got a nonsmoking room. Thereafter the room had the most minimal amenities. Besides the great location (near Dupont Circle), there was not much to say about this overpriced hotel. The room was small and in OK condition. The bathroom was small with a tub. The bathroom amenities were also minimal. We did not have a fridge or a microwave and had to again rent a fridge from the staff (to keep baby things).
The parking costs $-- per day so it is best not to drive here. Also the breakfast is not included. The lobby is very small and feels old. The only thing available is coffee in the lobby which is decent.
All in all, poor service, minimal amenities, small rooms, small bathrooms, no view, but great location. Some distance from the metro (either McPherson station or Dupont station). Try to look for better if available.",not happy
"Stayed here with husband and sons on the way to an Alaska Cruise. We all loved the hotel, great experience. Ask for a room on the North tower, facing north west for the best views. We had a high floor, with a stunning view of the needle, the city, and even the cruise ships! We ordered room service for dinner so we could enjoy the perfect views. Room service dinners were delicious, too! You are in a perfect spot to walk everywhere, so enjoy the city. Almost forgot- Heavenly beds were heavenly, too!",happy
"My girlfriends and I stayed here to celebrate our --th birthdays. We had planned this weekend getaway back in February, so we were all looking forward to it. There was - of us so we rented - ajoining rooms at the rate of $----night-room. We stayed - nights so with taxes and parking charges we spent in total over $----. All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards.
The rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made -- calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at -:--, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at --:--, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service.
I did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology.
Needless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of ---- and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at. If you are willing to pay Ritz Carlton prices, then I would recommend staying at the Four Seasons instead!",not happy
"We had - rooms. One was very nice and clearly had been updated more recently than the other. The other was clean and the bed was comfy but it needed some updating (carpet was old and wrinkled for example). Great location for visiting Inner Harbor, getting to Fells Point, Orioles games etc. SuperShuttle from BWI worked great both ways. TV remotes in both rooms were terrible but we didn't watch much TV so not a big deal. Wireless was sketchy on --th and --th floors but again, didn't need it much - we were on vacation so it didn't really matter. Breakfast was good each morning. Would stay again if in town.",happy
"My husband and I have stayed in this hotel a few times. Though not the fanciest hotel, we love the fact that we can walk the - or so miles to Fenway. It is clean and the staff is very accomodating. My only complaint is that the fan in the bathroom was noisy and went on automatically when you turned the light on and we tried to keep the light off as much as possible. We've stayed in pricier hotels which charged for internet and breakfast and these are both included. Will stay there again.",not happy
"My wife & I stayed in this glorious city a while back. SF is expensive, but we found this little hotel in a super location for a very reasonable price. By no means is it a --star hotel, but the room was clean, nice & well-appointed with quaint charm, despite being a bit small. Regardless of that, the staff was very helpful. I particularly enjoyed the wine-tasting evenings & the helpful, polite front desk.
Overall, I'd recommend this place for singles or couples, but for children present, you probably need a bit bigger room. For the location & proximity to everything (including a marvelous little Mexican restaurant around the corner), you can't beat this place for the price. SF is a magical city with plenty of things to do, so I'd recommend just crashing here & seeing the wonderful surroundings more than hanging out in a room all day.
Would recommend again for a getaway for -, but not for families because of the room size.",happy
"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Fairmont on a recent trip to San Francisco. I could not recommend this hotel more. 
I called the hotel a few weeks before to order a cake to be delivered to our room on our first night to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. I was immediately connected directly to the pastry chef who helped me to design the most delicious cake I have ever eaten in my entire life! 
The rooms are large and luxurious with a wonderful old-world feel. 
 Most importantly don't miss a dinner at the Tonga Room! What a fun restaurant. Definitely order a Scorpion Bowl, but only if you’re staying in the hotel -- they're strong!!",happy
"Wonderful staff, great location, but it was definately the price was high for a standard hotel. The free breakfast was great, actually pretty good quailty for a free buffet. This hotel is in the heart of it all, walking distance to everything. - things, please Hyatt...the coffee was bad and the white ginger line of shampoo-conditioner-soap smells horrible!",not happy
"Steps off Times Square, nice rooms, stayed - nights, great for a short visit.",happy
"Me, the Wife and - kids stayed here on Valentine's weekend ----. Really a nice hotel in a great location. It is connected to the Rivercenter Mall in downtown San Antonio. It is within walking distance of all Downtown SA attractions, (Alamo, Riverwalk, Ripley's, ETC.) Great Service from the staff from beginning to end. I definitely HIGHLY recommend this hotel and would stay here again if ever in San Antonio for any reason.",happy
"We stay at the Jolly Madison over the Xmas period, the main feature is it's location. You are never far from most tourist attractions from this hotel. Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.
Our room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.
We did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.
We took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.
Make sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.
The store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-(
Stumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though.
We did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like.
We were surprised at just how many people there were and how many shops remained open on Xmas day. This really is the town that does not sleep.
Our only regret was not having longer than - days but there is always next time.",not happy
"I highly recommend the Hawthorne Terrace as an affordable, comfortable spot in Chicago. The staff were pleasant, the room clean and spacious, and I really liked the neighborhood location. Tons of bars, restaurants, an improv spot and Wrigley Field are all within walking distance.
While the hotel provides a Continental breakfast, I'd recommend going across the street (at least once) to Anne Sather's. The hotel also offers free wireless Internet access in the rooms. I would definitely stay here again!",happy
"I found the hotel clean and nicely located. Good, free shuttle to the airport leaves twice per hour. The rooms aren't as nicely appointed as other springhill suited I have stayed at. The walls were thin I could hear a lot from adjacent rooms.",happy
"Stayed at the Elan from --th to --th October and, as we liked it so much, returned there after our - day trip to Vegas for another - nights. Unassuming in appearance, the hotel scores heavily for its great location, spotlessly clean, classically designed and very comfortable bedrooms, and the friendliness of management and staff. Jorge and his colleagues on the front desk were a revelation with their untiring and enthusiastic help in recommending great restaurants, places to visit etc. And management were particularly helpful in letting us have a complimentary room post-check out to freshen up for our evening flight home after a long day enjoying the Southern Cal sunshine.",happy
"Priceline sent us to this hotel after accepting the bid at --- USD a night, tax included. We checked in the night before Thanksgiving with a family of four including my --year and --year old boys. Upon inquiry, the hotel staff gave us a room at the lowest level, the --th floor, facing Time Square. While this is a standard room at this hotel, we had a pleasant surprise the very next morning to watch the entire Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from the comfort of our room. The location of this hotel is just impeccable. I highly recommend those who wish to celebrate special events near Time Square to stay there. Maybe we will do it again for the New Year count down.",not happy
"Old and cheap furnitures,our chair was simply destroyed,old painting on the wall,you feel like you are back in the --'s not ----...Kids running non stop early morning next to our door starting -am...The entire room shake...And for $---.....I don't think so!",not happy
"We stayed here for - nights and were really happy with it. It is located about --mins walk from the walk of fame and graumanns chinese theatre and is on most of the tour companie's pick up routes. Our room was nice and big and was very clean. Breakfast was included and it was really nice, the usual toast, cereal, pastries and cooked things. You also get free use of their internet in the business centre, as well as the gym and pool. The reception staff were really helpful in givin us directions etc. There is a minimart, subway and starbucks just across the road which is convenient. Also just off the walk of fame is a shopping mall with shops like Gap, Superdry, etc. There are also a few restaurants there as well. For anyone who likes pizzas I would recommend visiting the California Pizza Kitchen at the mall - pizzas are lush there and are rasonably priced. We got a shared bus to the hotel through Super Shuttle. It cost approx $-- return and pick ups occur every ----- mins from airport. Be warned of the way they drive tho, it was a slightly frightening experience after -- hours on a plane! 
We didnt have a car there so did all organised tours, one through VIP tours and one through Starline Tours. The VIP tour was a tour of LA including Hollywood, Venice Beach, Downtown LA and Beverly HIlls. This lasted approx --- day and was really worth the money. We then did an escorted trip to Universal with Starline which was well organised and Universal is worth visiting!! We also went to Madame Tussauds on the walk of fame which had some good and bad statues!!
Overall though the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame is worth staying at, its clean, convenient and has some nice free extras thrown in!!",happy
"The service was fine, but the hotel itself fell way below my expectations from such a respectable establishment as Hilton. They were nickel-and-diming me all the way. 
-. The carpet in the corridor is not very clean and it smelled weird there. The pool area was no better - actually, much worse. I wouldn't recommend going barefoot anywhere in that area. It's just dirty.
-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.
-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.
-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.
-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. 
-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.
Summarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again. Hope the savings were worth it.",not happy
"Having stayed at many Hilton properties, I expect a friendly efficient service from what is considered a good brand.
This property was a let down. Initially, things went smoothly. Check-in was fine, as a HHonors Gold member I was informed with an apology that they did not have an Executive Floor to upgrade me to, but put me in a - bedroom suite and offered me a complimentary buffet breakfast and the usual wifi vouchers. This is where the good things ended.
The room had issues. Initially, the phone in the living room did not work. They sent someone up to fix the phone, and then some --- hours later it just started randomly producing high pitched beeps (which in turn woke me up). In addition, the guest compendium was empty (as in someone had removed the pages). It took - phone calls and - people to come up to my room to actually understand what I was requesting, and deliver a full compendium.
I also had cause to contact and visit the front desk at various stages later in the evening during my stay. To say the night staff were next to useless would be an over-statement. The night manager basically said nothing to my requests, or as little as possible. They treated me like I was putting them out of their way and disrupting them being lazy. One particular staff member was so bad I wrote a separate complaint to Hilton about them.
I also witnessed a lady in obvious distress attempting to get a room late one evening. When they informed her she was not able to get a room without photo ID she became upset and aggravated. She ranted a little bit about 'if I get murdered tonight, it'll be on your conscious' to which the night manager replied """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""That's ok Ma'am, I have no conscious"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". 
I've never seen such rude staff. Would I stay there again? Definitely not by choice.",not happy
"This is everything you could want from a hotel - convenient location a short walk from everything in uptown Charlotte, well-equipped room (fridge and microwave as well as the usual coffee maker), and efficient staff. When we first checked in and went to our room, our room card would not work. In less than -- minutes, a repairman arrived at our room to let us in and dismantle and reprogram the door lock. There is also free wi-fi in the room - an all too rare feature in hotels.
My only issue was trying to do online check-in for our flight from our room and not being able to follow the instructions for printing our boarding passes. The printer is in the business centre, and while the instructions say that you can send you document there to be printed from your room, it would have been easier to just go to the business centre and use the computer there to check-in and print.",happy
"I very much wanted to stay at a boutique hotel near Times Square in lieu of a Hilton or Marriott type. After some research, hubby and I compromised on The Paramount after seeing the price of their modern chic rooms on the website. When we checked in we were both excited about the impressive lobby. Very us. BUT we were royally disappointed when we entered our King Deluxe room. Womp womp womp...
I'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.
The pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.
We headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.
We headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadn’t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.
I've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed. No point in showing you the view out the window, it was the back of a building.
If you care to know:
NYC was insanely booked everywhere last week. We did manage to secure - nights at The Bowery (LOVED it, ---% guarantee that we will return) and the - other nights of our trip were spent at the Marriott on Times Square with an incredible view of Times Square.",not happy
"I really liked this hotel. The staff were wonderful and quite helpful in providing advice about visiting Old Town and things to do in San Diego. In the lobby-reception area, there was a table set up with ice water, coffee, etc., which was very convenient and appreciated. There is a little sitting area off of the check-in area with brochures galore, so you can sit & relax, drink coffee & look at brochures. Adjacent to this is the place where they serve breakfast. They really do serve a nice breakfast, waffles, etc. The hotel rooms are nice. Nothing fancy, but pretty spacious, clean and comfortable. Overall for the money, I thought I did pretty well in booking this hotel. Good value for the money.",happy
"My wife and spent - days there this month as a New York getaway vacation Christmas present to each other. Our stay overall was terrific. The quality, size, quietness, and location of the room was supurb. Every staff member was friendly and willing to help. Complimentary wine reception every evening was a definite plus. We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived and were reluctant to leave. The Muse is a calm oasis in the bustle of New York City. As a Kimpton InTouch member we were upgraded automatically to a superior king room. It was large well appointed and quiet with a view down --th street. The bed was extremely comfortable. They just began a complete renovation of the lobby so there may be some inconvenience until it is completed. Our only bad experience was the District Restaurant. We ate there Sunday for breakfast. Service was mediocre, the bacon and eggs were both overcooked and it was tremendously over priced. Such a fine hotel should not have such a bad restaurant. Other than that I would recommend this hotel very highly.",happy
"We stayed at this hotel for two nights over the busy Labor Day weekend. 
We arrived at about -:--am after flying in on a red eye. Our room wasn't ready but we were told that since the housekeeping staff began at -:--am, and that the guests previously in our room had already checked out, that our room would be ready for us by --:--am. We went to breakfast and returned at --:-- and were told that our room was still not ready. We waited another ninety minutes and checked back with the front desk and were told that they would put a rush on our room with housekeeping, that they were in the process of cleaning it, and to come back in a half an hour. We did, and the room still wasn't ready. By that time we were both exhausted and perhaps the front desk person took pity on us and upgraded us to a junior suite. 
The room was quite large especially for New York hotel rooms. We had views of the street from two sides, which we enjoyed, but it was noisy. It didn't bother us, but I think it would wake up a light sleeper. The bed was comfortable and the reading lights had dimmers. The desk was large and had a power strip.
We chose this hotel over the other InterContinental in New York City because of the price, location, and previous reviewer's glowing comments. There were a few little details that just didn't compare with previous experience we've had with this hotel brand.
The furniture looked a bit shabby with scuff marks on the table and tired looking furniture, chipped paint. The bathroom had a light fixture hanging loosely from the ceiling. There was some mold on the ceiling in the shower area. There were a couple of times that I had to wait over five minutes for hot water in the bathroom and the bathroom sink had a constant drip. One of our towels had a large hole in it. I know it sounds like nit-picking, but I've become accustomed to a certain level of expectations when staying at an InterContinental hotel, and for the reasons above, the Barclay didn't meet those expectations, in my opinion.",not happy
"Took a girls trip to LA and had no idea where to stay. After research we settled on Elan. I'm so glad we did. Very nice, clean, handy hotel. There is no restaurant but that was fine by us. They had a continental breakfast in the am and wine and cheese in the evenings. We went out to dinner anyway. That's kinda the point of visiting LA---eat! The hotel staff was wonderful, particularly Michael O and Michael K. Both were soooo helpful from making the reservation to suggestions on where to go, shop, eat....They always made sure we had a cab when we needed it and made excellent suggestions. I would absolutely stay there again.",happy
"Stayed with my girlfriend for a long weekend. 
They gave us a nice comp upgrade at check-in...thanks! Hotel is beautiful, service is good. 
For a five-star, it fell short in a couple of areas...
There was a large, very gross looking yellow stain on the comforter. We had to ask that they bring a new one. Not a pleasant sight.
Also, a couple of guys on the bell staff were blatantly ogling my girlfriend as we were walking to the elevator...very tacky. Granted, she's very attractive but you would think the staff would have a little more class than that.
All in all, great place and we would highly recommend.",happy
I have stayed here numerous times and never been disappointed. The staff is helpful but not overbearing. The location is fantastic. The price is right. It is clean and the business center is in a living room!,happy
"The public areas are nice to look at. The staff at reception were helpful and check-in was met with a warm greeting. The staff in other areas were mostly courteous and professional but the bar staff was wooden and unhelpful. The room itself was a decent size but not big. Furnishing were comfortable enough. The internet was unbelievably slow and had to call the hotel's IT department - times to troubleshoot problems. Not acceptable as they charge $-- a day for internet service. If you use the valet service, expect to wait upwards of -- minutes whenever you want your car. Returning in the evening after dinner, waited about -- minutes to be acknowledged by a member of the valet team. The staff seemed to smile alot but lacked any substantive abilities when dealing with any issues. Had a minor problem with my booking that took far longer than necessary to resolve as the staff were dense and difficult to talk to, as though it were their first day on the job. This hotel seems a magnet for conferences but I couldn't recommend this place for business or leisure purposes. There are much better choices for the money they charge.",not happy
"Denver is an excellent city to visit and this hotel makes that visit all the better. Although Hampton Inn is on the lower end of the Hilton family, this particular hotel out does many higher ranked chains by providing a well managed facility with great touches like free wireless, free hot and cold breakfast and a young but highly trained staff. 
The only con about the hotel is the parking. It is costly to park any where in downtown denver but this is true for any metropolitan area. The proximity of this hotel to interesting locations nearby for fun and dining makes it worth the extra cash to have a place to park. 
Highly recommended.",not happy
"I really liked this hotel alot. 
Staff was extemely friendly and helpful. Rooms and common areas were very modern and looked very well maintained. If you chose to eat in, there was a nice little kitchenette. Great internet service. 
Short walk to the riverwalk. 
If I had one thing to complain about, the breakfast selection was a little light, well at least for my taste. 
Given that, I would definitely consider Home - suites if I were to visit this area again. (And I hope too)",happy
"We could easily have stayed here for longer on our trip through California. It's a delightful Inn that is totally unique in its surroundings. It stands out on the block as no ther buildings look the same as this one.
All of the rooms are traditionally decorated, elegant and rich . We had the Garden Room with large comfortable bed dressed with antique bedding. This room has a Victorian tiled ensuite shower room which looked lovely and functioned perfectly
We enjoyed the breakfast of homebaked scone and a choice of cooked bacon and eggs. 
You'll love this place if you appreciate period details and individual flavour. If you want all mod cons like a coke machine, coffee makers and trad American breakfasts then it isn't for you. 
We walked to Bilboa Park and the zoo but didn't explore enough in the evening to find a restaurant to recommend - it seems a quiet neighbourhood. We made it to wine tasting though and enjoyed chatting to the hostess and other travellers",happy
"I booked three nights at the Inn at El Gaucho based on the reviews from tripadvisor.com. When my boyfriend and I arrived after a - hour flight from NY, we were happy that the Inn is located only -- minutes from the airport by taxi. The hotel is located on the second floor of a steakhouse, with no elevator and no bellhop, so we had to carry our bags up a flight and a half of stairs. (I knew about this from the reviews, but after a long flight I had forgotten!) The woman at the front desk was very helpful, even leaving to personally check if the room was ready because we had arrived early for check-in. It was, and she gave us a large cold bottle of Evian, a goodie bag with large cookies and a CD, and a short tour of our room and its amenities. We were also given - room keys, which is helpful. 
The room was a suite (they are all suites) facing -st Avenue. The bed looked like one large pillow and it was amazingly soft and comfortable. We had to force ourselves, after testing it, to get up and do some exploring around town. The room had a --"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" TV which came in handy because we were there to see the Seahawks VS. Giants that Sunday at Quest Field Stadium, so we were able to keep track of the teams and highlights on a picture-perfect TV. The bathroom had a stall shower and was pretty basic - hairdryer, lots of towels, and complimentary toileties. The room closet had a dresser, iron and board, and - ultra-soft bathrobes. There was also a seperate coffee-office closet which was pretty convenient, yet out of the way. And the leather sofa and chair were nice, as well. The most useful thing in the room was the pile of Seattle guides on the sofa table. We used that to find all the restaurants for our entire stay. 
The Inn is located only a half mile from Seattle Center (with Space Needle) and less than a mile striaight down -st to Pike Market. It's only a little further to Pioneer Square and Quest Field Stadium. And it's only - blocks away from the Seattle Port. First Avenue has an abundance of restaurants and shops so you won't have to worry about taking a taxi to dinner. (There's even a big umbrella for you in the room closet, just in case you have to take a short walk in the rain!) 
Overall, we were so happy with our choice that when we go back to Seattle for whatever reason, we will be staying there. The location, the comfort, the moderate price ($--- a night in Seattle is hard to beat) and the friendliness of the female employees made it a perfect stay!",happy
"Looking for a tranquil retreat in Denver that is close to great restaurants, shopping, the Botanic Gardens, the Art Museum in theCherry Creek neighborhood? This is the place!
We had read about slow parking valet times, but our waits for the retrieval of our car averaged two minutes! I suppose if you wanted your car during intervals of high turnover (check-in and check-out), it might takelonger. I suggest you ask the valet staff if you are concerned.
Back to the hotel room,we specified a room with mountain views and got a nice one. Large large bathroom with separate tub and bath appointed with marble floors and granite countertops. rooms facing west in the summer, you might want to leave your AC a little lower before you leave for dinner. Linens comfortable and pretty. The wallpaper was bold and dramatics...nice touch!
Hope to return soon for another relaxing stay...eat and drink at North restaurant...-- steps from the front door of JW Marriott. You will not be disappointed!",happy
"Booked - rooms, at check-in they upgraded all of us--- rooms to suites. The front desk staff AJ, was wonderful, made us feel great. Didn't use the pool, so I can't write about it. Right across the road from Texas Roadhouse. The breakfast had scrambled eggs, biscuits & gravy, waffles. Will stay there again.",happy
"I stayed here last Thursday - Sunday. I attended a business workshop on Friday, and my hubby and I stayed through the weekend for leisure. Check-in was smooth and fast, and the staff were courteous and knowledgeable. The lobby is nicely decorated in a contemporary style, but the building sure shows its age once one heads up to the guestroom floors. The woodwork outside our room was so battered looked as if someone had been hacking at it with an ax. 
On the positive side, I liked the overal design of the room, and the bedding was of nice quality. But there were some serious flaws. The bathroom cabinet was cracked so severely that some of the wood veneer had copletely fallen off. And, although I asked for a nonsmoking room, the place smelled strongly of smoke. We are not smokers and didn't spend any time with smokers during our trip, but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room. When we got home and unzipped our suitcases, the smell of smoke was extremely strong. I had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that I had just purchased that very weekend at Saks.
Other positives about this hotel are the location. It was very convienient to Magnificent Mile shopping and attractions. The cafe attached served great coffee, and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order. And, again, the staff were helpful and pleasant. 
Overall, the room was a good value, but the the stay would have been much more pleasant if this hotel made some basic maintenance efforts.",not happy
"I'm not a fan of hotels so hate business travel but this hotel was a real pleasure. Fantastic pop-art style, enthusiastic staff, modest rooms with elegant 'pop' furnishings (I hate overstuffed rooms). Great location, though a little bit of a walk to nearest Metro station.",happy
"My first stay at a Kimpton property was on a Friday, for a business trip in DC. I booked a room at Donovan House with - criteria in mind: location, and value. The location of the hotel was convenient, as it was near the National Mall and government offices but also within - mile of several other points of interest. I based value on the overall perks-to-cost ratio. It's not scientific, but based on the feeling of, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""did I get a good deal?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The first impressiom of the services was upon entering the parking garage. Valet parking is available on-location, but for the steep price of $---day. They may have mentioned that detail on the website, but I still think the Kimpton management could negotiate a better contract or reduce the overhead fee. Parking for one night added an extra --% to my overall cost. The lobby is crisp and decorated in modern style-color scheme with unique lucite bubble chairs. The decor didn't have much of an effect on my mood, since the mod furniture and walls were predominately upholstered in aubergine and burgundy shades of vinyl. I guess it just wasn't my taste, though the eye catching details could be perceived as young and fresh.
Upon check-in at -:-- pm, the friendly receptionist informed me that my room was not ready due to cleaning (?!) but that I could be upgraded to a suite. Softening the blow was the fact that I had arrived just before wine hour, which, according to my research is a standard Kimpton perk. Sweet. After pushing my way past a bellhop carriage stacked with supply boxes, I waited for the elevator in the narrow corridor. On the --th floor, my spacious suite greeted me with the stale smell of cigarette smoke-as though it had formerly been a smoking room (though Kimpton properties are smoke-free as the room placard informed me, this hotel recently changed management). The area rug that overlayed the carpeting was askew. This wasnt necessarily a sign of uncleanliness but probably that nobody checked the room before my arrival. The rest of the room was exceptional: crisp Sferra linens on the bed and duvet, a clean bathroom with a large soaking tub and designer shower that were consistent with the other elements. After a quiet and comfortable night's rest, I took advantage of the complimentary coffee bar in the lobby. The brew was exceptional-was encouraged to take a second cup to-go, as well as a bottle of water. Detail-oriented hospitality was top-notch, and I have no doubt that the staff would go out of their way to assist any guest. Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to enjoy the rooftop pool and bar that are features of the property. Overall rating: ----. Be sure to check AAA and government rates if you qualify.",not happy
I had a runaway this weekend to the Ritz and was disappointed. The room was amazingly noisy. The air conditioning didn't work--even after engineering said it was fixed the temperature kept goin up. The roll on my burger was stale and hard.... I expected so much more.,not happy
"Okay the hotel-motel may not be a - star appearance and the rooms are well they are rooms.. but for the money - I have a fridge, hot breakfast, free internet, nice pool and pool hang out area, quiet neighborhood day and night yet only blocks from stores, waterfront, and restaurants and a nice sized balcony and free milk and cookies at -pm. Not bad at all... 
But it gets better - I am a priority club member (but anyone can be.. just sign up for free) and I must say its been a long time since I was greeted so kindly on check in (for being a valued priority club member), and given a check in present (lotion and razor in a beautiful carrying bag) and upgraded to a room looking towards the bay and allowed early check in (-- am) and a managers greeting from ----- every weekday with FREE ALCOHOL and nibbles. Okay.. I admit...

"We are starwood preffered guest members and got a rate of --- for a saturday night so we jumped on it for a quick getaway. We arrived to a -th floor lakefront view and a great little room. The hotel looked really nice. The lobby was really cute, as most W's are, and the gym looked amazing. Pool didn't look too bad either but we didn't use it. WE had drinks at the bar and the bartenders were great. We went to see a show so we took a cab. When we got back later that night they had a DJ in the lobby so we had a few martinis. We went back up the room and ordered room service which was just find until there was a long blonde hair actually inside my burger which ruined the meal. The next day we had breakfast in the lobby restaurant which was excellent, and then we went to the spa and each had an -- minute treatment that was excellent. The spa was very nice and I took advantage of all the locker room amenities. Overall it was very nice, minus the roomservice mishap. The rooms are very modern but clean. The only major flaw was that the room is small to begin with and the put slat wood sliding doors and a window on the bathroom, so there isn't much privacy. 
I laughed that the mini bar had emergency contraception supplies next to a W teddy bear, as well as room service breakfast that was fruit, whipped cream, chocolate syrup, champagne, and hold your calls for an hour for $---.",happy
"I was in town for a conference at McCormick Place and stayed at the Wyndham Blake for two nights. Yes, the location is slightly away from the main flow of traffic but that is what made it great for me. Quiet area. Short taxi ride to MP was fine with me as well. Took orange line from Midway, got off at the Library stop and short walk to hotel. Right across the street is a Ginos so if you need your fill of Chicago deep dish, Ginos is there to assist. 
The hotel is quaint. Older buildings which have been merged to house the rooms. Very good service from check in to check out. At night, a bar is beside the lobby area with comfortable seating. Very relaxing space. As for the room, I was a large room with a King bed. Clean. The bed was very comfortable with crisp linens. Decor was fresh. View out of the window was the brick wall of the building next door. Did not bother me as I was only in the room to sleep and do some end of the day work. The bath was also very good size with a walk in shower....very nice. Another reviewer noted the rain head for the shower and low pressure. I will take the other side of the commentary. The pressure in the shower was very good and I loved the oversized rain head. If you did not like the downward stream, you could direct it slightly to get more of a traditional shower experience. I liked it so much, I am adding one to my soon the be remodeled bath. The only negative about the shower was the caulking had some mold. Maintenance needs to scrap out the old and replace with a tan colored caulk. 
Overall, I am very pleased with the property and would stay there again without hesitation.",happy
"We stayed at the hotel just two weeks ago and I'm still so impressed. 
From the moment we walked into the clean and accommodating lobby, to the check in process, room (more on that in a moment!), and most importantly - a most professional, helpful and awesome staff.
We were blown away. I've stayed in Manhattan more times than I can count - this is by FAR the best hotel experience I've had (sorry Ritz.)
We were upgraded to the Penthouse level (yay Hyatt rewards program!). Oh-em-gee .... a roof patio! The room was gigantic - especially by NY standards. The lounge is awesome and I'm in love with their espresso machine. The concierge was very helpful and we had a few ideas where we wanted to dine the last night and Eataly was great experience. She suggested it for a unique experience over the hotel restaurant. 
Most of all - the staff went above and beyond. Jordan was so awesome - he handled our check in (room wasn't quite ready, so he had us relax in the lounge while he handled check in) and he risked life and limb during an epic thunderstorm on our -nd day to score us a taxi to get to an appointment on time. 
I will not think twice when booking my next hotel in NYC - Hyatt -- Lex is terrific hotel and excellent value. Yes, you can find cheaper hotels. But I found it to be terrific value for NYC and we enjoyed the amenities. Wow. Such an outstanding experience and I can't wait to return.",happy
"Comfortable rooms,a little glitzy for my taste which tend to be reasonably priced. Thats because the factilites are a little limited. There is a quiet bar area and there is a restaurant attached where breaksfast is served - but that is it. Rudimentary gym 
Room service is OK, save that they ask $-- for a pot of tea! 
Make sure you ask for a room overlooking the street. The hotel is rectangular with a central void space which half the rooms look out on. So you tend to have to leave the curtains drawn all day.",happy
"Got a awesome rate here - $-- a night for a Radisson in NYC. Good location - about - blocks from Grand Central Station, about - blocks from Rockefeller Center. Away from the chaos and noise of Times Square but close enough to walk to sites and subway stops.
Room was a good size, especially for NYC, desk, flat screen, - drawer dresser, closet with safe and our room had - twin beds. Both room and bathroom were clean. 
Negative is the windows are definitely not soundproof, had asked for a high floor and unfortunately didn't get one - was told it wasn't available but could ask again the next night. We heard all the noise -trash trucks, sounds outside, etc..honking, sirens. 
Other then not having soundproof windows, I would recommend staying here - nice place and nice location",happy
"We booked this hotel based on the fairly good reviews, but our experience combined with the price of the room, make it a disappointment. Hotel is well located with a couple of good places to eat and a Starbuck within walking distance. The walk to the Grand Central Station is of about -- minutes. Staff was friendly, but when we ask for help to print one page with the reservation for the ---- Memorial, they referred us to a computer and printer they have in the lobby, which costs a minimum of - USD. Moreover, when we ask for help for transportation to JFK, they recommended a town car for -- USD and when we asked about the airport shuttle they did not recommend it and gave us another price than the real one, which we found weird. We ended taking the bus for -- USD each and it worked just fine. The room was large bur very worn and not very clean. There was a kitchen but no pots. I will only recommend this hotel if you get it for a very reasonable price. In a future NYC trip I will for sure stay somewhere else.",not happy
We spent - nights at the Sofitel Washington from Friday -------- to Tuesday --------. The check in process was speedy a most friendly. We made a special request at was accommodated without fuss or any attempt to collect extra fees. The staff is polite friendly and service was seamless. Our room booked through Expedia was clean and spacious with very nice amenities. The staff will always greet you with a friendly Bonjour or Bonsoir every time they see you... The Sofitel is a bit of Paris in DC! Very charming.,happy
"The lobby and rooms are clean, chic and lovely, and we found an attentive staff who promptly delivered extra pillows, ironing board and iron and gave us a free box of cashews when the ones we opened from the honor bar proved stale. Our only real objection was a very small room with no room for an ironing board to begin with, queen, not king size bed, tiny closet and no place to put your luggage so it has to be opened on the floor. Sound transference between rooms was also a problem along with door slamming in halls. On balance this was a good value b-c we paid under $--- on Hotwire, but I would have been bummed if I'd paid full freight.",happy
"this trip to new york was organized by my fiance for my birthday and this place was incredible. The hotel room was unforgettable because located on the -- th floor. The walls facing the bed are the windows so you have the impression to be in the clouds. GREAT VIEW (room ----)!!! Room very quiet and the bedding is good quality! However, one negative point: I stayed for - nights and the first morning we left at -am and when we returned at -pm the room still wasn't done! the maid arrived at -pm to clean the room! I didn't ask for anything because i did the bed by myself at -pm ! for the remaining services, the hotel is new so the staff is not perfect but they try! nice snack in the morning with coffee and a choice of - different muffins ! I recommend it for the room with this amazing view!",happy
"I agree, not fancy. But everything we needed. Breakfast, pool & hot tub were nice, shuttle to airport, later check-out time. We did have a noise issue which was tough to sleep through. It's been awhile, so I forget if it was a noisy door nearby, or noisy guests. I complained to management through a later email and, to their credit, they comp'd us MORE than the amount we had requested! We would return.",happy
"This is a nice hotel. I don't always like airport hotels, but this one was pretty good. The person checking us in wasn't excited to see us, but the folks at the coffee shop downstairs were really nice, as was the concierge.
The room was nice - recently re-done. Very comfortable. 
Oddly, about - floors' worth of the soda machines didn't work. We reported it to the front desk.
The parking situation was weird, since it doesn't belong to the hotel, I think. Hotel guests park on floors four through seven of the garage off to the side, but it seems to be event parking as well. We had to stalk parking spots, since it was really crowded, and some jerks in giant cars took up more than one parking spot. We could have done the valet parking, but the self-park was a great deal ($--, I think).
The workout center was in need of more ventilation (older building - window a-c units), and it is a little small, but they have what you need: cardio machines, free weights and a bench, and a multi-station weight machine. You can also purchase access to a nearby club. The sign in the workout center does suggest that before exercising, you speak with your physician and follow *his* advice. They need to update their signage, clearly.
Otherwise, really nice. I will likely stay here again.",not happy
"Just spent one night at this property. Very nice. Beautiful hotel (I've stayed here before and it's been through some sort of remodel). Rooms were incredibly spacious, especially for a city hotel. The gym was great - well equipped and with cold towels to boot. Staff was incredibly friendly and went out of their way to make every guest's visit special. Just blocks from Georgetown and also from lots of sightseeing.",happy

"Stayed here for - nights in late March. Our flight arrived in the morning, we got to the hotel at around --am. We had a PL reservation, tried to check in at --am for a king size was told by the friendly lady in the front desk none available right now, will reserve one for me for -pm and asked for my cell phone in case one is available before that, she'll call me. 
We drop our luggage off and went to eat lunch at Darren's Cafe, then walked around the Wharf. At around -pm, she called me and said our room is available which surprised me b-c I didn't expect she'll really call me back and I'll have to go back at -pm to check-in.
Room was ---, on the other end from the elevators overlooking Columbus street. It's a quick - min walk from the elevator to the room, we didn't mind the walk since we're young but older folks might not like this walk from-to the elevator. Room was decent size, looks like recently renovated, thin walls, small bathroom. Since Columbus is a busy street, you'll hear buses and garbage trucks in the early morning. It didn't bother me that much, I grew up in Brooklyn where our house was next to a major highway. A couple of buses and a garbage truck is nothing compare to back home.
We didn't come to SF for the hotel, our favorite part of the Marriott is it's location. Within walking distance you're in the Wharf where you'll find Hollywood Cafe (excellent breakfast place), Walgreens, IHOP, Barnes and Noble, Hooter's, Dennys, Gary Danko (make reservations early), Bike Rental shops, In-N-Out Burgers, The Cannery, Bouldin Bakery, etc... Skip the rental car, I know they want $---night for parking here, the hotel is next to several bus stops (hence the noise) and - blocks from the F-line tram (in front of the Walgreens).
Overall we enjoyed our stay here, thanks to the friendly staff, we wouldn't mind staying here again.",happy
"The Good - The room was really just my taste. It was perfect. I don't know what else to say but that. The bed was very comfortable. What I loved the most was smelling the fresh sheets. I felt like I was in a laundry commercial. I could not stop smelling the fresh linens. The city view was perfect although I must say Philly skyline looks better in the day than night. Their free breakfast was really like a mini-buffet, notice I did not say continental. It was really huge, or at least larger than other hotel chain's continental breakfast. I don't eat pork and I was able to get cheese eggs. The free internet was crazy fast. Checking in and out was a breeze. The entire staff was very helpful and I would stay again. 
The Bad - I arrived -:-- (-- mins early) although check-in is -pm. I didn't mind the room was not ready then but was bothered that it was not ready until -:-- (-- mins late). The heater is not central based meaning you have to control it yourself and the vent was extremely loud. I opted many times to just not run it because it was just too loud to sit through. 
The Ugly - After coming in one night, there were people hanging out next to the elevator and wall with no shoes on. I assume they were maybe taking a break from their room however the hotel does have a lobby for that. It was not a good site to see shoe-less guests hanging out on the wall and at the elevator. On my last night, I was awaken at -am by rude guest who had been [--] the entire trip. After going back to sleep, I was then awaken by hammering. The hotel is renovating a little. I was also charged for local calls after being told they were free. During check-out, I told the front desk and was given not only a free room for the hammering but no charge for the local calls.",happy
"The staff was SO GREAT! I travel a lot and have never had a staff be so friendly and helpful. I actually changed my room - times and they were great about it. My first room was on the -- floor (too high for me), then I went to the --th floor (the electrical outlets didn't work in the bathroom, and then I was in ----, GREAT room!!!! Fabulous location!!!",happy

I left saying my stay was """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""just ok."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I would rather report them to their franchise than deal with them as they clearly don't care about their guests. Ironically, their horrible way of manging this hotel and dealing with guests surely has got to hurt their business. Treating your guests with respect makes them want to return and spend more $$$$$$$$ duh!!! I cannot recommend this hotel based on my experience here.

"I am told that John Dillinger once robbed this place when it was a bank. It is certainly historical and projects an image out of the ----s. The hotel is clean and comfortable with good service and an excellent breakfast. The hosts will make you feel at home in a better than average Hilton Garden Inn.
There are two issues: There are only four ---minute unloading parking places in front and you have to fight the cabbies and then the valet parkers to get one, even for a moment. The valet people shamelessly hustle tips and will demand that you move if they are not paid off. Self parking (recommended) is in a garage just --- feet south on the west side of Pennsylvania Ave. You can pull a ticket there and then have it validated at the hotel. The second issue is that the blackout curtains are an inch too short now that new windows are installed. This means east-facing rooms learn about sunrise about -- seconds after it happens.",happy
"Housekeeping was just mediocre. We asked for an additional bath towel and hung it up for reuse. It was taken away the next day and not replaced.

We were placed in a handicapped room (the only room available). After midnight of the first night a strobel light and loud beeper for the phone kept sounding, though we had no phone call. The desk couldn't explain it and said they'd have to call engineering and it would take a while. We had to disconnect the wire so we could get some sleep.
Internet charge was ridiculous but you could get an hour free in the lobby.",not happy

I immediately filed an incident report with Ashlee Easterling and suggested that a mat be placed in that area. When we left on Sunday morning, water was still puddling in that area and occasionally, wet towels were being replaced by dry ones. My family and I took pictures of the puddles that kept accumulating during our stay. I was very lucky that I did'nt suffer more severe injuries, and the staff were not proactive in preventing another accident. While I was in line waiting to voice my concerns, the manager on duty, I believe his name was Jesse was arguing with two guests. Jesse was not successful in calming the guests and was saracastic. When I spoke with Jesse about getting a a copy of the incident report, he was again sarcastic and snobbish. Guests should BEWARE of leaking ice machines!",not happy
"I was in town for business and had chosen the Hyatt because all of the good hotels in Center City were full. I prepaid for my hotel room a week and a half in advance to hold it for late arrival, but when I arrived, I was sent to a hospitality suite with only a sofa bed. The brand-new alarm clock on the bar- with the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""--:--"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" sticker still on it- was also a particuarly classy touch. Not only had the front desk employee not told me that I was being sent to such a room, but she ignored me when I called down to complain. Twenty minutes later, the night concierge told me that this happens often, since the Hyatt apparently overbooks its guest rooms fairly frequently, and that my (furious) reaction to my """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""guest room"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" was typical.

"We booked our stay at The Hotel Sax Chicago with Hotels.com, we got a very good deal and last minute too.
On arrival we were very impressed with the lobby area, all be it small, it was bright and airy with crystal and glass in cabinets all around. The doormen were very attentive too. 
It was when you entered the lifts that the bright and airy feel dissapeared. The lift was very nice and oppulent but dark, once up to the --th floor, we were met with a very dark, slightly creepy in a nice way corridor. This hotel must have just been renovated because everything was immaculate.
Our room was a surprise, it was quite big and even though the decor was a little busy, we did like it, the bathroom was large, with good qaulity fixtures. The bath towels and robes were light and fluffy and the tioletries were replaced everyday. The soaps they use a lovely too, and WOW what a great shower. 
The room itself had a very large flat screen TV mounted on the wall, we also had a floor to ceiling mirror on one wall and floor to ceiling windows. The bed was super-king size and the bed was very comfortable. As we are super fussy on bed quality we did make sure the beds were pillow-top and it was like a big marshmellow.
All the fixtures and fittings, looked to be brand new. Be warned though as some of the mini bar items, water, ect, snacks are placed on the tray with your glasses and cocktail shakers and they are not free. 
We did have room service once and it was good and reasonably priced. We ate at Bin-- for breakfast a few times and found it very nice indeed.
There is a new Bar called The Crimson Lounge, gosh this place looked like a Vampire's Lure, very gothic, red and so dark, you could hardly see the person sat next to you on some tables. It was very busy on the weekend we where there, with lots of young girls aged around -- - --, dressed to impress, not our cup of tea really.
We did like Chicago, not so much as NY but we managed to see lots of sights. 
Harry Carays is a nice Bar ect. We also at at SMith and Wollensky but to be honest the over bearing waiter really put ut off. 
ALl in all the Sax is very well placed in the Marina, right next to the House Of Blues, were you can watch blues and eat good food, we managed to go on Sunday for the Brunch and gospel Choir, was fantastic and en experience. 
Our only gripe was our view out of the windows, of the Corn Cob Towers, the car park hosts the first -- floors, so being on floor --, we had a view of the spiral car park and also the noise. 
However all in all it was a great hotel and well worth the money.",happy
"I am becoming a loyal Marriott customer, due to the really clean rooms, thoughtful furnishings, and comfortable beds and linens that one typically finds as a standard, but this time, I was bit annoyed that we didn't have the hotel at its full capacity. Parts of the hotel and the grounds are undergoing renovations, which we didn't find out until the day we arrived, so fair warning for anyone reading this review. On the other hand, the location near the convention center and other restaurants and shops is ideal for those who like to walk and explore during their trips. (Tip: Listen to the SD natives who kind of look askance when the idea of visiting Old Town is the topic. We didn't take their advice and ended up being seriously underwhelmed by Old Town and its surroundings. Instead, visit Coronado Island if you have a free afternoon during your conference. Those few hours along the beach and walking through the town on a sunny afternoon were the most memorable and pleasant of all during our SD stay.) I would recommend this hotel to friends only after it finishes renovations.",happy

After learning that this was a top rated hotel in Philly, I decided to give it a try. Everything was perfect, and the staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful! The room was very clean, modern, a good size, and ours had a nice view of the city. The hotel is in the Rittenhouse Square area, which has excellent restaurants and shopping. And they offered several perks for our stay - a later checkout time, a place to store our luggage after checkout (so my wife and I could spend more time in the city), and restaurant recommendations. They even left us two bottles of water and popcorn in our car, when it was picked up from valet parking! The wine reception they hold every night in the lobby is also a nice treat, and a great way to be welcomed to this unique hotel.",happy

"I stayed for over a week at the Affinia Shelbourn. It was terrible, rundown and the service was the worst. The concierge tried to rip me off on a ride to the airport and when I questioned her overpriced quote, she told me that if I didn't like it, go ask the doorman for advice on car services.
One elevator was out of service, yet they didn't tell me that when I made the reservations. I had this problem once before during holiday time with a NY hotel, so had I have known, I would have made other accommodations.
One night, there were dirty towels or something left in the sink by the housekeeper that day, who obviously was in so much of a rush, she left the items in the sink. Disgusting.
When I made reservations and then when I checked in, I asked for a room with a view. My view was the back alley next door. Bait and switch.
The hotel room and whole hotel is shabby. I tried to move out to another hotel the day I checked in, but being Thanksgiving week, it was hard to find other accommodations since the city is full. I got a survey from Affinia a week later, when I told them of the rude staff, rude concierge and lack of services they said they would make it up to me. They lied, They gave me nothing and ignored the problem. I will avoid all Affinia Hotel's in the future. They don't care about the guests at all.",not happy
"Just loved the Hilton Garden Inn in Tribeca-Soho area just off Ave of Americas and Canal St. Little Italy, the Financial District, Greenwich Village, and Chinatown are all in close proximity. The property also sports a restaurant with an excellent selection of tap brews and offers valet parking for $-- a night. May seem like a lot but that is pretty much the going rate for --hr hotel parking in NYC. The room was clean, the service was top notch, and helpful maps are offered free of charge. The room was very quiet and we slept soundly. They even allowed us a -:-- check out free of charge. Breakfast is also included in the rate and they offer coffee, cereal, bagels, fruit, juice and eggs any way you like (including egg whites) with all the stuffings.",happy
I have stayed at Hotel Deca twice and I can't wait until I get to go back. The restaurant is fantastic too!,happy
"This hotel is disgusting. It was booked via my business, but otherwise I would have checked out on the first night. From the beginning the tone was set by the rude guy at valet. The restaurants were dingy and the rooms felt like old NYC style apartments. Ripped wall paper, terrible springy mattresses, gross bathroom, very loud AC unit. I asked to be switched to a different room because I didn't even feel safe in the one that I was in. The second room was larger, but not any better. I would never stay here again, not even if the room was free. It's spooky and feels like there are ghosts here. I can't wait to go home!",not happy
"This is a very old hotel. If you consider its central location, nice lobby and friendly stuff, you get the idea that this property was comfortable and stylish at the time. But now it badly needs the renovation. I don’t mind the tiny size of the room, I even liked the design, but the wallpaper were dirty and torn in several places, the bathroom was so outdated that I even had to ask for a housekeeper to show me how to use a plug, which was no way automatic! Whenever you look, you see very outdated details.
Another bad thing about the hotel is the fact that you can hear almost everything that is going on next door! And I mean EVERYTHING! You hear when people get up, go to the bathroom, whisper!! One night I was even fricked out because I thought someone was trying to come in to my room, although in reality my neighbour attempted to come in next door.
I didn’t try breakfast which was not included in the room price, but there’s a Starbucks just in the same building – no problem with that.
All and all, I wouldn’t recommend the hotel, although it is a pity, because the stuff is really trying their best and the location is very convenient.",not happy
"This is a great small hotel in the city. It is in a slightly quieter part about - minutes from -th Avenue, which is quite a relief after a full day in the city. The rooms are spacious for a small hotel with high ceilings. I would recommend avoiding rooms at the back of the hotel where we were as there is a pretty noisy air conditioning unit. The staff are very friendly and we can strongly recommend the restaurant. The steak is exceptional and the service equally good. We would definitely stay again.",happy

"My wife and I recently stayed at the Henderson's Wharf Inn and we definitely enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious, the beds were very comfortable, but the room could have had more light. We kept our shades closed because our room was on the ground level (as are all the rooms) and we did not want walker-runners along the pier peering into our room. But, our view from the room of the harbor was lovely.
Service: There could be more front desk staff. During our stay, it seemed like the young lady working the front desk was extremely busy and she was the only person at the front desk working until the next morning. Inspite of this, she provided great service. The bottle of wine upon check-in is a nice touch.
Food: the continental breakfast was fantastic and was one of my favorite aspects of the hotel. The continental breakfast offered nice variety and the fool was delicious. The woman who tended to the breakfast was friendly and efficient; she provided great service.
Value: Truly, the only issue I had with the hotel was the price. It's an expensive hotel for what one receives. My wife and I have been fortunate to travel and stay in some great hotels worldwide and it seems in our travels; we have experienced more for what we paid for at other hotels than what we paid for at the Henderson's Wharf Inn. The Henderson's Wharf Inn is a nice hotel and I will recommend it, but it could add something more.",happy
"We were not staying at the Swisshotel but used their valet parking while we had lunch at the Palm. When we got the car back it was obvious someone had driven the car further than just to the garage and back. First we told them we were just having a quick lunch but they took the car away and we had to wait forever to get it back. Then we noticed that the car had played through - CDs we had loaded in the CD player, which doesn't happen when the car is parked and off. And our car is two years old, it isn't even a new hot car. We didn't bother to complain because i am sure we would just encounter denials and attitude. All I can say is don't trust them, and make sure you make a note of the odometer reading if you must use their valet.",not happy
"The room was upscale, the facilities upscale, but the hotel was populatednot so much by guests, but rather by roving patrons of the lobby and upstairs bars. The scene is very hot in the bars, but the hotel needs to keep non-guests off the other floors.

"Stayed two nights with DH at this excellent hotel. Platinum upgrade to a gorgeous suite - even the bathroom had a hallway! Comfortable bedding, swank sitting area, spotless bathroom with Bliss products. Common rooms were gorgeous - loved hanging out in the lobby to play checkers, or a drink I guess. We were there during a very quiet time when the rooftop club was closed so room on the --th floor was ok, otherwise staff said they put guests wanting a quiet room on the -th floor so try to book that ahead of time. Location was perfect if you want to visit Hollywood Boulevard sites (you can just walk out the door), Griffith Park, Laugh Factory, and the Hollywood sign are a short drive away.",happy
"This was the most amazing one nighter I have ever experienced! From the moment we got there we felt like Royalty. The staff was exceedingly friendly and so very helpful. Jose Rosales answered every question we had. We got there early and they stored our luggage for us while we walked to the Alamo. When we got back we were shown to our room which was simply put, HUGE. We were able to upgrade to a suite and was worth every penny. That evening we were able to host some friends for after dinner drinks. Thank you so much Hyatt, Jose and the rest of the staff for making us feel welcome and comfortable.",happy
"i stayed at this hotel in mid-August for work, our conference was in the hotel. i found the different floor motifs to be quite amusing! I was on the --th floor, and i do recommend if you are at all superstitious to let them know at check in that you prefer a different floor! my room was nice, and clean, but it was one of their smaller rooms with just one queen bed. It was nice and the bed was very comfortable, i had no problem sleeping. But if i was paying for the room myself, or if i was staying longer, i would have preferred a larger room, because although nice & cozy, it would be too cramped for a longer stay. all in all, a nice place very convenient location.",happy

"We travel for work and I'm constantly looking for new and intersting places to stay. The Inn at The Black Olive was perfect. I didn't feel like I was stuck in another hotel but rather staying somewhere fun and relaxing. The location was amazing and the beds are really comfortable. The restaurant upstairs was excellent. Everyone was really nice and helpful. i only had a few thoughts that weren't totally positive, but they in no way will keep me from staying there every time we're in Baltimore for work. The TV in the living room was on the smaller side. As I don't watch TV a lot that doesn't really matter to me. There was no dock or stereo hookup for an ipod. Would have been nice, but again, I wasn't there to just sit in the room for hours. They only carried glass bottles for water. I get why for sure but it would have been nice to have something more easy to carry outside the hotel. Maybe have water bottles in the room that they can charge for?",happy

"Just back from five nights in the Belvedere and felt the need to write in support of the hotel. Location cannot be faulted, short walk to the subway, Times Square and the theatres on Broadway. Our room had a kingsize bed and was on the --th floor it faced the back of the hotel, it was extremely quiet and the view was good. The room was very spacious and much larger than I thought it would be having read some previous reviews. It was also in good decorative order. Yes the bathroom was quite small, but just how much time do you spend in a bathroom when there's so much to see and do in New York. Housekeeping was excellent.
The price represented excellent value for money and this comes from someone who never books anywhere without first checking up on tripadvisor.",happy
"I stayed here for a seminar and wasn't expecting much. After all, you are pretty much locked in to this location. I wouldn't recommend commuting o McCormick Place on a daily basis... 
Anyway the hotel was very clean, staff was attentive and always friendly (they even told us how to get free Internet). The room was clean and modern but the highlight of the entire stay was the shower! Holy cow this thing had pressure and was instantly hot! It was like our own private spa! 
Overall a great place to stay and the hotel was clean, close to the city activities and the only real option if you're in town for a convention.",happy
"I had stayed the Elysee's sister property the Casablanca in June and really liked it and decided to try the Elysee because of the location in midtown. This was going to a quick -- hour trip from LA to NYC so I e-mailed the hotel ahead of time and requested a room at the back of the hotel as I'm a very light sleeper, and with the trip being so short I was really hoping they would me able to accommodate me. I had booked a deluxe king room. While checking in I was told that I had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite at the back of the hotel. I felt like reaching across the counter and planting one on the nice young man! I was escorted up to my suite and absolutely giddy with delight as this never happens to me. The suite was spectacular! The living room was very large for NYC standards and had a plasma tv in the armoire. The bedroom was equally large and spacious and the bathroom was done in marble. I only wished my stay was to be longer than -- hours.
The complimentary breakfast can be delivered to your room for only $-. I called and requested this service in the morning and it was brought immediately up which consisted of a large pot of coffee, bagels, and fruit. I tipped the deliveryman and dug in! I couldn't believe what incredible service I was getting. 
The wine and cheese in the evening was generous and relaxing. The free wi-fi in the room was also very much appreciated.
What sets the Elysee apart is the staff. Each request or inquiry was met with a professional response. The hotel is boutique style so its very intimate and the staff addresses you on a first name basis, making it feel like home. 
I travel to NYC quite a bit for business and pleasure and I have tried them all, but this will be my new home away from home. The abundant complimentary breakfast, wine and cheese and free wi-fi make the Elysee such a great value. And no, its not cheap, but what is in NYC? If you add in the complimentary services and the fantastic staff the Elysee simply can't be beat. And thanks again to everyone who made my stay so effortless. Only wish I could have stayed in the suite for a week!",happy
"This Residence Marriott is not fancy. It was clean, good service and suite style rooms; however, it's a little older than some Residence Marriotts's I've stayed at and probably could use an update soon. There was nothing wrong with the hotel, it was a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""good value"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in the area, but if you're looking for something a bit upscale there are other hotels that will suit better. For the money, it was fine.
There was a bit of noise at night from loud music and garbage trucks that kept me awake. A free breakfast in the lobby was standard free hotel breakfast grade - nothing special but overall ok. Although the location isn't prime on the Riverwalk, it's a - minute walk to all the sights downtown and easy to walk everywhere.",not happy
"My wife and I stayed at the Lucerne with our two boys (-- and --) for three nights last week (April ----). The room (two double beds) was small, but not an issue for us as we were not in the room except to sleep. The lower cost is worth the trade-off in space. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. The neighborhood is great fun. We enjoyed being in an area where people live. Places to eat (especially breakfast), Central Park, and the museums were within easy walking distance. The subway stop was on the same block as the hotel, and on a line convenient to many of the sites you would want to see. We went to Times Square one night and were glad to have a quiet area to return to. Overall, the Lucerne is a great place to stay and see the city.",happy

"My stay at the W City Center was a Dr. Jekyll- Mr. Hyde type ordeal. For every task that they did well, there was an equal and opposite task that flopped. 
As a former frequent traveler I have stayed in many different hotels ranging from - stars to - stars. And, lately, I have been having good, solid experiences booking - star hotels for my leisure trips through priceline, but my stay at the W City Center in Chicago ended that string of luck.I had read many other reviews on this website before my trip and I felt like I had enough information to know what to expect, but I was wrong.
I rated my experience at the W a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but it was closer to a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-.--"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and just like in math class, I rounded down. I am not sure what the exact criteria is for star ratings, but for service, the W City Centre is a solid """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-.-,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but that's as good as it gets.
My flight landed at Midway at about -:-- am, so I took the Orange line and arrived at the hotel at around --:-- am. I was expecting to check my luggage, but to my surprise I was able to check-in. And, according to them, they upgraded my bed from full to queen and gave me a courtyard view on the --th floor, so that noise from the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""L"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" wouldn't bother me. What a joke!!! 
My bed wasn't even a full, it was more like a double... maybe even a twin-and-a-half. My wife and I, who sleep in a King at home, were practically on top of each other. And the courtyard view, looked more like the view from a project in Brooklyn. And, I understand that the interior rooms in the hotel have no choice but to have a view like that, but please don't tell me it's an upgrade, when it really isn't. I would have rather heard the train and had a view of the outside world, than to feel like I was in prison.
The room was tiny! After I learned was staying at the W, I looked it up and saw that the rooms were small, but the website doesn't do the room justice. There was exactly enough room to turn around, but that was about it. there was a lounge chair in the corner that was unecessary in that size room and the desk where one could use a laptop was at the foot of the bed. When you pulled the chair out to take a seat, it hit the foot of the bed, so you had to squeeze into the space between the desk and the chair. At -'-"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", --- lbs, I'm not a huge man, but it was a feat for me to do that.
The television was in a cabinet to the left of the bed, so I had to turn my head at an awkward angle to view it. And, the question that kept running through my mind was, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""If this is a - star hotel, where is the plasma TV?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I have stayed at many other - star hotels in Chicago that have had plasma for years and if I remember correctly the W Lakeshore has plasma TV's in it's rooms. 
I liked the fact that there was a safe in the room for my valuables, it made me feel much more comfortable about leaving certain things in the room. But, it was a too small for my laptop.
The bathroom was also very tiny, but it had a full-sized tub and a fantastic shower head. Also, the little Bliss sample products were great so I purchased full-sized versions. The toilet was extremely noisy, but I believe I figured out why. The flush was a little longer and stronger than a usual toilet, but I think it was so that all """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""debris"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" could be cleaned with one flush instead of possibly flushing more than once. I mean it's so loud, the flushing next door would wake my wife in the middle of the night.
The service at the door was great, but it came in spurts. At one point there might be three gentlemen opening the door, but at others there might not be any, only the person that hails cabs for you and if your hands are full and he's busy, then you're stuck! I didn't see a handicapped button you can push to open it automatically.
The location is decent. You're very close to the Orange and Brown line trains, two blocks from the Blue line and - or - blocks from the Red line. And, unless you're going out at midnight, like we did, there is usually a cab in the vicinity.
Overall, this is not a - star hotel. You either have great service or none at all and I didn't appreciate being misled to think I was receiving some sort of benefit. I decided not to patronize the restaurant (Shikago) or bar (Whiskey Blue) because there are many other places in Chicago I'd rather spend my money. Please do your research. The W City Center is a great -.--- star hotel. It's not even close to being - stars.",not happy

We stayed on the --th floor, and our room facing --th Street was a bit noisy, with the - AM garbage truck, ---- police sirens and what have you, so if you are sensitive, you might want to chose a room facing the back. Otherwise the hotel was flawless: the desk downstairs, amenities, cleaning, the bed, everything just perfect (and we are pretty fuzzy). Free wireless in the comfortable business center (but a charge of $-- if you want it in your room). Faboulus value for the location and standard. Highly recommended. And a nice breakfast deli just next doors.",happy
Stayed for a graduation and was looking for the best value in the Galleria area. I found it! I love how cozy the place feels; the lobby reminds me of an old country inn. The room was spacious and especially liked the seating area next to the bed. Had breakfast and must say that this place has the best waffles. The buffet had everything you need to start your day. Especially great is the complimentary business center where I was able to use the internet and print my boarding pass all at no charge. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was pleased and would absolutely stay here again. Did not use the pool but it looked inviting and those using it seemed very happy.,happy
"Booked this hotel on a special deal, stay - nights and get - free. Also offered $-- credit towards breakfast each day, which was advertised as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""free breakfast"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as well as free unlimited mini bar in room, free wifi, etc. Most of that was great, hotel was very nice and clean as well as updated, the staff was extremely courteous and knowledgeable. Only issues we had were on the deal we booked as there seemed to be a catch to each of the offerings... perhaps their marketing was a little bit more generous than the actual offerings were in reality. - night free was great, except that they charge you for that night anyway upfront then credit back to you several days after you leave... not the best if you didn't plan on taking that money out of your wallet on a family trip (we booked - rooms, so the extra charge was $---). Breakfast credit sounded great except that a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hot"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" buffet was $-- for one person and if you ordered a la carte it was still going to add up to roughly $-- each. We had - total people, - adults, - kids and it was all we could do to keep the bill under $--- each morning for breakfast. If the breakfast was actually good I wouldn't have minded but it was lacking to say the least. Matter of fact the free items in the lobby were just as good and FREE! lol. I do not recommend eating here if you're staying, complete rip off. Mini bar in the room was a nice touch, everything but the alcohol was free. It's not """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""unlimited"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as they advertise, they restock once for each day so use it wisely. Other than that, the rest was good. Rooms do offer limited privacy in the bathroom area though as the toilet glass door is mirrored but the shower door has no frosting or mirror to block spectators. Good if you're with your spouse, bad if you have kids in the room. :)
Overall I'd recommend it if you can get it for the rates we did as it's nice and in a good location on Wall and Water. And yes, read other reviews on the location... this hotel is really on Water St, not Wall if you're trying to drive to it.",happy
"A great location just off the Magnificent Mile on Illinois, almost at the dividing line between The Loop and the Magnificent Mile. My wife and I stayed here and could walk to the northernmost tip of The Mile and as far south Millennium Park. All staff including front desk, valet, breakfast staff and cleaning staff were outstanding. Our room was a king suite with seperate dining area, living room and bedroom. In wall safe was an appreciated item. I requested an inside room, not fronting Illinois, to reduce exposure to the fire trucks screaming out of the fire hall next door. Noise was not a problem. Rate was around the $--- a night mark, great value for this gem.",happy
"I don't doubt my experience is the exception, based on the reliable reviewers' posts, but it should be noted for those Tripadvisorists who live by reviews... that this isn't a perfect hotel.
First of all don't get all excited, thinking you're checking into a fancy Hyatt. It's a roadside property at the bottom end of the brand. The rooms are spacious and funky, which is always a welcome addition to the cookie cutters out there. For that I am deeply thankful. 
That said, it's still a cheap hotel. And in my case, a smelly one. Perhaps it was just this room, though I doubt it. The elevator area had a chokingly bad smell as well. The smell that permeated the entire studio suite was foul. Foul to the point of keeping me up most of the night. Foul to the point of burying my head in the (comfy) pillows to suffocate myself. Foul to the point of leaving my clothes with a stench of, I don't know, a combination of paint, cleaning fluid and old war bandage that needs to be changed. I opened the window to the -- degree winter, but even that didn't clear the air. Really really unfortunate. 
They did put my able self in a handicap room when I checked in after midnight, so maybe I just got the leftover room that nobody actually wanted. I don't know. 
Yes, it's inexpensive for the amenities and space you get, but if you can't sleep for the stench, than it still costs too much.",not happy

"We recently stayed at this hotel. The hotel is close to Baltimore Harbor. Walking to this location is not an issue during the day. However after dark it does not feel safe! My husband and his friend were propositioned by a shady character after dark.

"I was pleasantly upgraded to a Lake view room, which is always nice.
The room was comfortable, but here's a disclaimer. Because of the funky W styling, there are a set of shutters in a window that seperates the bathroom from the sleeping area. If you're traveling with a companion, this would not allow for much privacy, but if you're traveling alone it enables you to see the view of the lake while you're literally standing in your shower. 
The lobby bar area is fun, but seemed to close rather early.",happy

First off, I'd called about parking and was told the rate was $--, I specifically asked if that were per day or for then entire stay and the hotel said the entire stay, you pay once (I called hotel directly). Not so. So right off the bat another fee adding to an overpriced room. Our room is a double suite and very small. The electrical outlets are jammed, the lights turn on and off consistently. The hotel staff said, that happens. Our TV would not work, and internet access? No luck there either.

"We're traveling with a group on an escorted bus trip and the hotel was selected by the tour operator, so I can't comment on price or value for money. The room we had was on the top floor overlooking the parks, so we didn't have any problem with street noise. As others have commented, the rooms are a bit tired, but the huge king size bed was comfy and everything was clean. Our tour guide must have let the hotel know that it was my birthday and there was a lovey card and bowl of fruit in the room when we arrived. The hotel was pretty busy as it must be a popular stop for bus tours; the staff were pleasant, but obviously rushed. Prices in the on site restaurant looked okay. It was an easy walk for us to everything we were interested in - Willis Tower, start of Route --, Buckingham Fountain, but we dont mind walking.",not happy

We ended up staying at the Affinia in one giant room with two king beds. The room was above our expectations. We did cut our vacation short because of the snafu but it had nothing to do with the treatment we received at the Affinia.

-. One night, Sunday, I went to the pool (around -pm local time) and the skimmer-pump was turned off, so the water was stagnant and kinda cloudy. I don't know if it was just bad timing, but it was a big turnoff. Otherwise the facilities are very clean. If the pool is open til midnight (which is generous), keep the pump on, please.
Overall excellent experience, but with --% in taxes on top of your room rate, you can easily spend three hundred a night and I don't know if location and magical service is worth that.",happy
"I stayed here one night on a business trip. Got a great rate compared to the downtown hotels. This is the only hotel that is at the entrance to the airport, so if you want an airport hotel, this is it. It is also right in the middle of the marina with boats and beautiful views in every direction. 
Check in was quick because it was late night. Got upgraded as a SPG member even though I was paying a very low rate. The room was bigger than average because of the curvature of the room. Exceptionally clean with --"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" flat tv and nicely decorated. King bed was big and comfortable. I only heard one plane before I dozed off, but the room is sound proofed well. 
The lobby is bigger then most hotels downtown. It has a great social-computer center with free Internet and computer use. There are two restaurants and two different bars, and a full service Starbucks. Although the prices for food in the bar were high, I think they are on par with most - star hotels. While the menu had some high priced items, there were many items in the $----- range. 
Although parking is $--, this is the same if not less than what many - star hotels charge downtown. I have paid as much as $--. 
Since there are dozens of hotel choices in the downtown area, this hotel only makes sense for me if I don't need to get around the city. Although only - miles from the heart of downtown, it is on a peninsula and a little detached from anything other than the marina and airport. On the other hand, it's location provides great views, particularly at sunrise and sunset while viewing the big city in the background.",happy
"As a life long fan of the New Yorker and the famous Round table legend, I checked in for a long weekend -------- worried that after a recent renovation the Algonquin couldn't possibly live up to expectations. But it surpassed them- I loved this hotel and as much as l like to try new places, it will be hard to pry me away from here on future visits. Deliciously old fashioned in the best ways imaginable. Great, polite, accomodating service without the snooty attitude common at so many other famous places; small and intimate ambience- the doormen will remember you! ; understated and classy lobby and bar; great location. Despite recent renovation still feels like Dorothy Parker would be at home here. 
Yes the rooms and baths are small, but the beds are as comfortable as any ritzy resort and, after all, its New York. You aren't going to stay in your hotel room all day anyway are you?
If you like modern, soulless box hotels or snotty must-be-seen places- go elsewhere. But if you want to feel a part of the living history of New York, count yourself lucky if you get to stay here-its the best!",happy
Enjoyed our stay at the Thompson LES. Loved the neighborhood! only complaint is that we could not cool down the room. It was near -- almost the entire time. Complained once and they sent someone right up. They said because it was still cool outside that the hotels ac unit wont kick on until it hits a certain temperature. Well I guess it never hit that temperature because we set the room at the lowest temperature and it never cooled down.,happy
"The room was very nice, modern and clean. The location can't be faulted. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, without being intrusive. The roof top bar is just as awesome as it looks in the photos, and the barman there knows what he is doing when it comes to cocktails.
The hotel restaurant was one of the few places in the US where I have found what I (as a Brit) consider to be a decent breakfast.
A couple of little niggles - there's no out of hours rooms service at all, and also no way to make tea or coffee in your room. If there's no room service, they should at least give you a kettle.
Overall though, a really nice hotel and I would happily stay there again",happy
"Even though Travelodge Space Needle is inexpensive, I wouldn't stay here again. Serious noise problem due to the fact that it is in close proximity to city fire station. In the three nights I stayed here, the sirens went off - times in the middle of the night. Also lots of outdoor noise from outdoors late at night. Also, hotel is remote - you have to walk for blocks to get to a restaurant, and it is a three block walk to the monorail, which is the main method of getting downtown. Lack of cleanliness was apparent -- carpet was filthy - big stains. Front desk staff were not particularly helpful.",not happy
"My husband and I went to a business conference and stayed here. I travel for my job about --% of the time and stay in hotels all the time. I would have to say that they have some of the best customer service I have ever seen, and I am picky. I think the extras do add up, like the valet and the food-bar is very expensive. The rooms are very clean with modern furnishings, but the building is really old and seems dated. Overall I would say that it is comfortable just ugly on the inside. Yes there is a train station nearby and you can hear it from the rooms, it did not bother me.",not happy
"My boyfriend and friends went to celebrate my --th B-day in San Francisco it was difficult finding a Hotel that would accommodate -- people. Being that is was my first time going I didn’t know were and what hotel to choose from I came across The Opal, it had reasonable prices online and was able to book with them over the phone with “Nick” very nice and informative. I had remembered after the fact that I have AAA and called customer service to find out if they give discounts they told me yes I would just show my card when I check in and get the discount. My posse and I got there at -am in the morning as I’m checking in the lady tells me they have no more parking and will have to park a block away, I was annoyed at the fact that if I booked - Jr. suites they should have enough parking to accommodate the cars arriving. I then ask about the AAA discount the lady tells me she can’t override the price only a manager can and he comes in the morning. I was upset and tired that I opted to fix the problem in the morning. We get into our rooms they are not what expected for Jr. Suites small rooms we had to rearrange our sleeping arrangements. The next morning I spoke with a very pleasant rep “Angela” at the front desk I explain the situation of the parking and AAA, she begins by apologizing she tells me how the discount works which is not how I was told over the phone the -nd time; I was unable to get the AAA discount but I did get - days of free parking worth $-- a day and a bottle of wine for my birthday which I was very satisfied with. She also was very helpful in giving us recommendations for restaurants and things to do in the city. I didn’t have any problems after that as a matter of fact the last day of check out was fast and easy “Carlo” checked us out told us how to get to the Golden Gate Bridge. I realized a day later on our drive back that I forgot my dress and my boyfriends dress shirt in the closest. I called right away they have a lost and found rep “Miriam” she was polite and helpful she said they did have it I asked if they would be able to ship it to me with no hesitation she said of course we can do that for you. I now have my belongings and back home with great memories to look back on.",happy
"This hotel is what you would generally expect a Homewood Suites to be like. The staff was very friendly from check-in to check-out of my two week stay. Breakfast was usually hot, and there was always enough food out. There is a Manager's Reception each Monday-Thursday night like at all Homewood's, but I did not attend one of those so I can't comment on the quality. The rooms are awesome. I was fortunate enough to be able to book a fireplace suite. They provide you one firelog for free, but any remaining logs you must buy yourself. They do sell them at the front desk, but if you are going to use more than - I would simply buy them from the nearby Target or Walmart for cheaper. The suite was very spacious. The bedroom itself is the size of your common hotel room. The living area have both a semi-comfortable chair, and a not so comfortable at all couch. The kitchens are equipped with a stove top and microwave, but there is no oven which I find to be a negative. At the very least, a convection oven combined with the microwave would be nice. You will not have a problem finding a place to store your luggage as there are plenty of closets and two sets of drawers. My room also had a patio which would be a nice addition for the Summer months. Some very important advice is that there is a railroad track that runs adjacent to this property. If you are a HiltonHonors member, you are given to option to select your room before you arrive. Rooms on the South side of the property and on the East side of the property are ones to stay away from if you are a light sleeper. My room was in the Southeast corner of the property (the absolute worst place) so I could actually feel the floors shake when the trains went by. Luckily I am not a light sleeper. As far as location, it is a short drive to several restaurants and a great shopping mall. Of course, not all business travelers have the luxury of a rental car so it is nice to be able to walk to restaurants. Well, that will not happen if you stay here. However, they do provide a shuttle that will take you anywhere within a - mile radius. I did not use the shuttle, so I can't comment on how convenient it is. Overall, this is definitely an excellent place to stay for the price. If you are familiar with the Homewood Suites brand, this property will not disappoint. Just stay away from the South and East side of the property and you will have nothing to complain about.",happy
"I've stayed here a few times over the years.
Don't expect a full-service hotel. That's not what this is. These are excellent short-term serviced apartments though.
If you need a base in NYC for a few days, or even a couple of weeks, they're clean, safe and well maintained. I've always had a very large room and a small kitchen, which means I've been able to fix my own breakfast before heading out in the morning.
There are ample delis, a Kinkos and Grand Central just around the corner. I've found the staff to be helpful, but not overly outgoing. There's no bar or restaurant - if you're looking for somewhere practical it's a great place to stay.",happy
"Stayed here August -- - -- and we were pleased with the visit. The decorum is definitely fashion over function but in the end we didn't feel comfort had been sacrificed for aesthetics. 
Our room was on the fourth floor overlooking West --th but we didn't experience any noise problems from the street below. The bedroom was typical in size for NYC, enough room for bed, furnishings, and space to maneuver. The bathroom was close to equal in size with the bedroom with a full shower and a wall shelf for toiletries. The bed was firm but comfortable, the closet and drawers provided plenty of storage space, and the lighting could be adjusted from subtle to extremely bright as needed. 
We visited the bar and ordered a cheese plate (rather plain) and drinks (fresh and delicious). The prices were typical for a hotel bar but the service was friendlier and more attentive than most we've visited. The bar is small but open to the street so there was still plenty to see.
While we stayed here we visited MOMA and attended a concert at the Beacon Theater. We had no problems walking from the hotel to the subway or nearby destinations. We did check our luggage at the front desk for a short period and had no trouble retrieving it later.",happy
"I was very worried once my boyfriend told me he had booked the Dream hotel and then read these review. Some are ture the staff can bea bit rude but nothing more than you would expect in New York. 
The room was small but wow how fantastic the bed was. I wanted to try and get it in my suitcase !!! But really if you are going to New York why would you want to spend all your time in your room. This hotel is not great for business people it is a trendy chic boutique hotel in Manhattan.
I would reccommend any brit to use this hotel, just for the location and beds alone.
The shower was lush !!! Just what I needed after walking all day and night.
The room service was brill (brits - all the freebies you can fit into your suitcase) the shampoo soap etc was lush !!! I still have some and it is brill.
The bar in the hotel is so nice... very very dark but very cool...
PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BE PUT OFF BY THE BAD REVIEWS. This hotel is not the best you will stay in, but for location, and chic it beats the rest.
I only spent a weekend in New York so location was everything, this did the job. - mins from Times Sq, - mins from Central Park.
- Mins from all the shops.
LOVE IT... xx",happy
"I recommend the Burnsley to anybody visiting Denver in a heartbeat! The Russian Gulag-chic concrete exterior is unfortunate but don't let that put you off... The Burnsley is in an excellent location only four or so blocks from the state capitol building and all tourist attractions are easily accessible - in addition the hotel offers a free courtesy shuttle within three miles. We got dropped at the Tabour Center and wondered back along --th street and took the day visiting everything there was to see and do. Parking is covered and convenient and the neighbourhood is safe and quiet.
The staff were wonderful, especially Wyatt, who despite seeming to be doing every job under the sun when we were checking in, took time to accomodate our needs and was really smiley and helpful (as were all the staff we met without exception).
The room was lovely; a two room unit on the seventh floor overlooking the downtown area and the mountains. The bedroom was generously sized, the bed huge and comfortable and the a-c nice and chilly! The main living area shared both the view and balcony and was comfortably furnished. The bonus of it's former life as an appartment block is the sheer amount of space you get for your money - lovely to have been able to have really spread out.
I would be the first to admit that it is perhaps a little outdated and worn in places (but certainly not unstylish) in some of it's furnishings but that somehow added to it's comfortable homely charms! 
In summary, if I could live there, I would!",happy
"My stay was -------- – -------- and I must say that your staff is one of the best I have encountered in my many travels. However I must say that I was disappointed in the hotel as a whole. The location is its biggest asset, but the room itself is not what I expected based on the pictures you have displayed on your website. The room was consistently hot no matter how low I adjusted the thermostat, the bathroom was a little outdated (based on what’s advertised on your website), and the cable TV had a distorted picture even after the Engineer tried to fix it. I had an issue with my billing on my room service and had to call several times to get it resolved (never received a call from front desk, they just slid an additional bill under my door) .I’m not trying to make comparisons, but I could have stayed in the Trump Tower for a couple hundred dollars more based on what I paid to stay at the property. They have a nice property, but to advertise it as a Four Star Hotel is misleading. I would have to compare it to a Springhill Suite or Holiday Inn Express just without a Concierge. This is not an attempt to bash the property, but to merely make one aware of how their website portrays an image that lacks just a bit of what is expected.",not happy
"I stayed here for a week on business and felt very welcome. The room was large and comfortable, with a plush and elegant feel. I was initially assigned a room directly above the restaurant, but the staff were very responsive to my request to move and arranged to move all my things while I was out the next day so my new, quieter room was ready for when I returned. 
Staff were almost always very pleasant and made me feel very welcome when passing through the small foyer (which does not really lend itself to any gatherings-meetings beyond an initial meet up). Overall, the standard of service was excellent. 
Food at the hotel's Firefly restaurant, and room service, was generally very good, although prices could have been more reasonable. 
The location is only a hundred metres from Du Pont Circle and the surrounding bars, restaurants and shops. It is within an easy walk of Georgetown (about -- mins) and a little longer walk (about -- mins) to the White House, Washington Monument, Smithsonians and memorials.",happy
"This was such a wonderful surprise for my wife and me. We have stayed in about -- different hotels in Boston over the years, inlcuding places like The Four Seasons. The Eliot is just the best of them all. The rooms feel like you are in a comfortable home. The staff beds over backwards trying to fulfill your every need. It is quiet but in a superb location right on Comm Ave in Boston, within walking distance to everything. I not only couldn't recommend this hotel any more highly but my wife and I will return here from now on with every visit we make to Boston. Nice job and thanks for a great trip.",happy
We've just came back ftom ny. Rooms are quite comfortable and clean but need a renewal ( at least the bathroom).

My husband and I went to Washington DC for the first time. We are so glad we stayed at the Westin City Center. Everything was a short walk or a quick taxi ride away. The staff were greeting and there for us with whatever we needed. We had a couple of personal special circumstances and they were generous and thoughtful. The hotel was clean and well maintained. The heavenly bed and dark curtains made it luxurious to rest and sleep in a little.Thank you Westin!,happy
"We went to Detroit for a baseball game ( our team lost to the kitties) the hotel is two blocks from Comerica , which was great . Has a excellent restaurant with a even better bar . Close to the people mover so we could go anywhere in the city with out driving , walking distance from Fox theatre also! Overall the hotel is clean , the staff is friendly and it's in a great location , only down fall was some street noise late at night , sounded like kids racing motorcycles.",happy
"I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel. I was in town for a conference and found the staff here to be so friendly and hospitable.

A special thanks to Shekal and Tanneshia.",happy
"I had sought out a budget-friendly hotel in San Diego that did not cost an arm and a leg. I had heard that this budget hotel is very Marine-friendly, and they are! They offer a free shuttle to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot as well as a free airport shuttle. A basic continental breakfast is included. The rooms are very clean and the management is wonderful. The desk clerk actually sought out my son (Marine graduate) in the lobby and congratulated him and thanked him for serving our country! This is not a luxury hotel by any means, it is a fairly basic motel, but I found it very convenient. People have commented that the neighborhood is not good....it is one of those areas that few would confuse with Beverly Hills, but it seemed safe enough.",not happy
"This is a very large resort that is sprawled out with different suites. We stayed in the Cambelback suites which is closer to the main lobby and water park. There is a resort fee that is tacked on and we were lucky enough that the water park was opened for the New Years weekend so at least felt we got something out of the resort fee. This resort offers golf, bike rentals, a jogging trail, golf and a spa. There are also a handful of pools to choose from if the water park is closed. The rooms and grounds were kept very clean and the staff is extremely friendly. I agree they could update the tv's but that is not really a complaint for me. The beds are extremely comfortable but do not consider the sofa bed a bed! Very uncomfortable.",happy
"I guess the old saying you get what you pay for is true. I did get a reduced rate because I am a Wyndham employee but this hotel is awful. I picked it based on the previous reviews. We stayed two nights only because that is what I budgeted our vacation for. The faucet in the sink was dirty, carpet coming up in the corners, pillows were so flat, some of them even had places that looked like they had gotten hot, Ac was not good the first night, hot all night, the next night was ok. It is not in a good neighborhood, but they do have it gated off and only one way in and out and a security guard, but it looks scary around there. Hardly anything for breakfast.",not happy
"Stayed at the Fairmont San Jose recently for a conference. It's pricey, but it must be the nicest hotel in downtown San Jose, and the room, food, and service were all top of the line. Really a very nice overall experience -- the conference ran like clockwork, the catering for the conference was akin to a five star restaurant's, and I really really miss that pillowtop mattress and sunken tub. Luxury all the way. The Fairmont made this trip more like a vacation than a business conference. I was wary since I have read some reviews that gave the Fairmont less than stellar ratings on customer service, but I was very impressed. From front desk people, to bussers at the conference meals, to securit when I locked myself out of the room, to room service waiters -- everyone at the Fairmont was helpful and cheerful and super friendly.",happy
"The location of this hotel is great if you need to be in downtown Denver. If you have a car, the parking is quite expensive. Also no free wi-fi. :( The service is generally very good and the staff is friendly; however one day they did not clean our room until very, very late. The manager did call to apologize. The bar at the top floor has a nice view. Go there for a drink or two. We have stayed here twice and would stay again.",happy
"Ok...so we decided to stay here again. After all, the location is excellent and it was one of the best priced Marriott properties in the area. We are Marriott Rewards members and always try to seek out their properties when it is time to book a vacation.
This time we decided to book a corner room because from seeing photos, they have a better layout and far better kitchen-area seating. Plus you have more windows. We ended up in one on the --th floor with a view up -th Avenue where you could see the beginning of Central Park. Plus, we had a partial view of the Chrysler Building.
I'll start with what is good about this hotel. First of all, the front desk staff is very efficient, helpful and friendly. The free breakfast is quite adequate---decent food if nothing to write home about. Also, the maids who cleaned our room during the course of the week did a great job. It also appears that the bed sheets have improved---they are a much higher thread count than what was there previously.
So...how is it slipping? The furniture is starting to get shabby. The hotel is only - years old but hotel furnishings seem to take a real beating. The granite countertop on the kitchen table had some indelible stains. However, what really got to us is this --- everyday the towels and wash cloths smelled unclean and were dingy. Plus some were even ripped or looked flea-bitten. This was very off-putting. Also, the hot water tended to go out from time to time. During peak times when many are showering, it is understandable. However, when it's a time of day when most people are out, it's really inexcusable. Speaking of the plumbing---the toilet often had to be flushed twice---not good!
We never experienced these issues during our last stay two years ago. What's up with that? Is the hotel cutting corners when it comes to properly laundering the towels? Are the plumbing problems being worked on?
Would we stay here again? The verdict is still out on that one. What I'm going to do is closely monitor the reviews here to see if things improve. If they have, we certainly would stay again.",not happy
"The hotel is very """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""compact"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (very small lobby) but from what I hear most DC hotels are like that. The room was nice, bed comfortable; only complaint was that the air in the room was REALLY dry and the fixtures are a little run down. The staff were very nice and helpful and MADE the stay for my daughter and I. 
Also, we were originally booked at the Rouge on a Snique Away sale but arrived at --:--AM and there were no rooms left so we were put in a taxi and taken to the Helix, room paid for by the Rouge. Definitely not ideal but I guess these things happen and the situation was handled promptly.",not happy
"When I first entered my room at the Blake, located conveniently near - El stops, I was pleasantly surprised to see a lovely, large room with a marble BR. Oops, when getting ready for long, leisurely hot tub bath, I noticed that the tub was missing!! 
I called the desk and asked about getting a room with a tub and they said--no tubs in the hotel, except on the first floor. I had only one choice of room--over the dumpsters on the first floor. At -:--am each morning I had close encounters with the smash, banging, clanging, even on Saturday. 
As I was paying full room price, I asked if it was possible to get a complimentary continental breakfast each AM. No, was the response, we don't do that. For $--, I had to battle with room service to give me both coffee and OJ on the continental. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""You have choice of only one"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". The pastries were delicious, though.
Also, I must say that housekeeping was superb, kind and accomodating. Front desk staff need to work on their smiles.",not happy
"We stayed at the hotel for - days, when we first arrived the man at the front desk was very rude. We had been looking forward to this trip for months and had researched the hotel prior to our stay. When my fiancé asked the man about the free breakfast buffet we had read about online he informed us that if we wanted the buffet we would have to pay $--.-- a day per person to get it. So the next morning we ended up skipping breakfast. My fiancé asked a different front desk attendant about the breakfast buffet they let him know that it was free and didn't understand why the other man had told us we would be charged. The location is ok, it costs about $- for a taxi downtown. We were switched rooms, and neither of our rooms had a refrigerator which was hard since we were staying there for a full week and couldn't keep any leftovers. Overall, I'm surprised this hotel is a Marriott. All other Marriott's I have been to have been a lot nicer! Its an ok place to stay, and the view of the lake is nice if you are on one of the higher floors.",not happy
"Paid $--- for one night at this hotel this week. Upon arrival was warmly greeted by the reception and portering staff which was a plus.
Unfortunatey the hotel couldn't offer me an overnight laundry or pressing service which was disappointing. Although there was an iron and board in the room so I made the most of what I had.
I was in room ---. A nice room reasonably sized with great view over the water and looking out upon the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""New Jersey"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" moored up opposite. The large king size bed was very comfortable. The internet help desk staff and room service staff were polite and helpful. The bathroom was lovely. Clean, new shower curtain and shower head, big mirror plus magnified shaving mirror etc. These were the plus points.
The decor in the room was a little """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""tired"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Paintwork was yellowing with age.
On a down side room --- was an adjoining room. The room it adjoined was occupied at the time of my stay. The door was locked in between but the noise was clearly audible. I heard them arrive back from dinner, use the bathroom, turn on the tv, talk to each other etc etc. 
In addition the door onto the corridor was close to the neighbouring rooms and I could hear them come and go too. This room is convenient for the lift being just around the corner but also able to clearly hear conversations of people getting in-out of the lift saying good bye to friends etc.
I was staying at this hotel for one night only and so didn't ask to swap rooms. Also the noise did not become apparent until mid way through the evening. It got a little quieter later in the night but I could have done with a long restful sleep in preparation for my transatlantic flight the next day. 
All in all a disappointing stay in what could have been a great hotel. Soundproofing around the doors would have helped.",not happy

"This was for a quick getaway to get away from the rainy weather in WA and get some sun and shopping in. We stayed - nights on a buy - get - free deal from Vacations to Go. Great Deal as always when it comes to Embassy Suites. Typical room for them included a sitting area with hideaway bed couch, desk and bar area with sink. Micro and fridge are great for an extended stay. Bathroom is seperate from the bedroom so the setup is great for families. The service here was better than the average Embassy Suites. The wait staff learned our names and really made us feel welcome. Right next to an outdoor mall, restaurants, and movie make the location good also.",not happy
"In the past year I've had the opportunity to stay at the New Yorker on several repeat trips . We had a couple of great rooms that stood out from the average room too for the same rate . No problems with any room other than one needed a few touchups and had a slow sink. That was the worst thing I can say . The location is ideal for getting around Manhattan . Penn Station , Macys , Post Office , Fashion District all close by and the walk to Broadway is easily done. One night when other family was busy I walked there and back in about -- minutes to grab an item I saw in a shop earlier.
The staff at the front desk of the New Yorker is excellent ,so willing to help and the restaurants are both fine even though quite different in decor.
 We dined at the Tic Tock many times over the trips and Coopers a couple times when we wanted some atmosphere . Never an issue , and the smiling staff members made our day.
Our rooms have always been clean and neat , well decorated . Housekeeping superb , never saw a bug , people aways cleaning during the day . It clearly shows they care .
My daughter lived there for part of her schooling and it gave my wife a secure feeling because the staff was so helpful. 
The place has chram and character . Love the history of the place too.
On any future trip to NYC it will be the first place I'd consider for a night or a week.",happy

"So, where to start. My party ended up in a single room at the Sheraton for Otakon ----, a local Japanese animation convention. Beyond the great location, the front desk hotel staff were great. The check in was efficient, quick, and very well taken care of despite the masses of people there. We arrived at -:--, we had our car taken care of and we were in our room at -:--. The valet was pretty inexpensive ($-- for three nights of parking, though it may have been per night but I'm not sure as they only charged us $--). Further, their platinum club lounge (as the one who booked the room was a platinum club member) was superb. The food was great, the people were wonderful. Finally, their bag check was efficient, well run, and very good. 
On the other hand, there were many many issues. First and foremost, our bathroom flooded. It happens. They were quick in fixing it but it's still an issue. They also forgot our towels one day, though they did deliver new ones upon being told. Their website was also very inaccurate as it advertised free wireless internet in the common areas despite there being no such service. On top of that, they lacked a book of amenities in the room and did not provide one; being hungry at - AM and wishing for room service or some sort of map, we were unable to procure one. The website was also very unhelpful, lacking hours and locations of things. Finally, it seemed that getting a card remagnitized without all four cards there would reset all cards and prevent them from working, meaning that by the end of the trip, we had only a single working card and no real means of obtaining new working ones. 
The neutral in this case was the room situation. We had - people in a room, one of which did not wish to share the bed and as he was paying, one had to sleep on the floor, me. As such, while I cannot attest to the comfort of the beds, they seemed nice. The room was of adequate size as well, though it lacked a refrigerator which was not good.",not happy
"Arrived late on December --th and was greeted kindly and hospitably by older women in very nice office,,,,Went to the room to settle in an found bathroom cabinets all wood rotted and fixtures corroded.

No coffee pot or hair dryer as promised. Terrible experience...",not happy
"We have stayed at the hotel Palomar as our -th hotel on our trip through the US. What a design hotel the Palomar is - a true gem! Although there is still some work going on, had absolutely no problem with it. When we complained about some minor deficiencies in the bathroom we were moved to another ultra design room (we could choose) of a size we have never experienced before (even the Bellagio in Las Vegas was smaller). The Palomar is and will become a top boutique hotel (once their advertised rooms with whirlpool etc are finalized). Our compliments to the designer! The staff is very attentive and accomodating. 
We'll be back.",happy
We stayed at this hotel based on the new renovations and the reviews on this site. As a frequent traveler - I take a very long time checking out facilities and reading reviews. One thing I DO NOT DO is google the address and do a crime check of the area. I will be doing this in the future. A hotel can be beautiful and serve a great breakfast however when you park your vehicle - parking spots from the front door and you walk out to leave and your car is gone - SHOCKED! It had been stolen at -:-- that morning based on the security tape from the hotel. The hotel informed us that they have one security person from -- pm to - am. Check the crime in this area and they should have a police officer on site for the safety of their customers. I am ashamed that I put my family at such a great risk and will continue to work on finding a way in which hotels can alert potential customers of the crime in the area. Any suggestions towards this would be helpful. Please DO NOT STAY HERE DUE TO THE CRIME RATE.,not happy
I have made it my home while in the DC area two times now and will continue to do so. Love the atmosphere and the staff. They make you feel more like family then guests.,happy
"I had a business meeting in NYC and took my family to mix vacation with business. Stayed in various hotels in NYC, but this was our first time at the Hilton. We had two connecting rooms on the --th floor. First of all the rooms were very spacious for NYC. On our last trip to NYC we stayed at the Sheraton Towers and the rooms were very small so we were very pleased with the size of these rooms. Second, we were very pleased with the housekeeping staff. The rooms were very clean and housekeeping did a great job everyday. The hotel is within walking distance of many restaurants and very close to several different subway lines. The concierge has typewritten subway directions to many popular destinations which we found very helpful One small problem, the hotel restaurant has a grade of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""B"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" which according to a NYC local is very bad since it seems that most every restaurant in the city has an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""A"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". We avoided the restaurant just in case. Also, the hotel has a huge lobby with very few chairs. Several times we wanted to stop in the lobby and talk to friends but there is no place to sit. Overall though a very good and clean hotel and a great location.",happy

We asked if they could do better on the rate due to the circumstances of our trip. They were very accommodating at first, then when I mentioned that we were going to go see a show the manager, Colin called me up to tell me that he felt duped and suggested I find another place to stay, that I was no longer welcomed at the French Quarters Guest Apartments. I was stunned.

"We have stayed at this Hyatt Place in the past, and it was a wonderful place to stay. However, on this trip, all of that had changed. Our assigned room was on the -th floor. The room smelled so bad, that it literally gagged us when we entered. The manager assigned us another room on the -th floor, and while not as bad as the first, it too had a very unpleasant smell. I asked the clerk if they had had any problems with the airconditioning, ducts, etc., and he admitted that they had had a serious water leak a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""few weeks ago."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I tried one more time with a room on the -nd floor and gave up. All of these rooms (and the entire -th floor, even in the halls) smelled moldy and fishy. The rooms were clammy, and the air conditioning system did not seem to be working properly. Additionally, only one elevator was working. That is the only elevator they will need if they do not correct this problem. I believe they have a serious water leak problem, and eventually, mold will be throughout the hotel. the staff was very nice and understanding. They did not bill me for the room when I checked out - hours later. Too bad. I really liked this Hyatt and its location on the River Walk (away from center and loud portion of the River).",not happy
"I stayed here on a Friday night before an early Sat AM flight. I was flying by myself and price-lined this place for a song. It was a very basic, no-frills hotel. The rooms could use a little updating and the carpet had a few tears, but it was nice and clean. As others have said, the full-wall width mirrors are a little weird, as are the TVs mounted on top of a closet-type cabinet. I guess there was a pool and a fitness room, but I didn't use either. I was surprised they put me in a double-queen room when I was by myself. The bed was comfortable and clean, as was the bathroom. It was VERY quiet (a pleasant surprise). I checked in fairly late (-- pm) and the night clerk was friendly and efficient. Parking was a little difficult (crowded), but I found a spot. I did the 'park and fly' thing - there was NO extra charge. The breakfast left a bit to be desired, but for what I paid, it wasn't bad. I parked for - days and simply called when I came back into town and the shuttle picked me up within -- minutes. I will DEFINITELY do this again to save on the stress of driving and parking the morning of an early flight. For less than the cost of parking at DIA for - days, I got a night at a hotel AND parking. I was happy - as I said; I'll do this again when I have to get to Denver early for a flight out of town.",happy
"This was a comfortable place for my Mom and I to stay the night we arrived in North Carolina. It was a fairly quick drive from the Airport and easy to find. The rooms were basic but the beds were fine, the rooms were clean, and it had an in-room coffee maker. The hotel has a continental breakfast that includes make-your-own waffles, but we ate both dinner and breakfast across the street at Cracker Barrel. We don't have a CB in AK, so it was a treat to go there. The are the hotel is in is fairly quiet. Accessing the freeway was easy the next day when we headed up to Marion. Warning if you're driving- use a GPS. The roads in North Carolina aren't marked all that well as far as assisting you to your destination. When we were driving back to Charlotte from Marion, I didn't see a single sign on any highway that said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Charlotte X Miles"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" until we were - miles outside of Charlotte.

"My husband and I stayed at the Allegro as my brother's wedding reception was here, and let me just say....both the service and the reception (and everything it encompassed) were ABSOLUTELY beautiful! Check-in was a piece of pie, and they were able to get my entire family checked in early, which was a HUGE bonus. They have a very nice lobby-lounge where they have complimentary drinks all day (and wine in the evening). We were all upgraded to suites and the rooms were magnificent and the beds are probably THE most comfortable I've ever slept in! The decor is very modern and sleek. I have to say that one of the manager's (Iris) is so friendly and accommodating - you cannot go wrong if you are lucky enough to get to work with her on anything you might need. 
I'm also a photographer and often shoot in hotel rooms, so after staying here for the wedding I thought this would be an absolute PERFECT hotel to shoot at; I booked my room for a few weekends later, and once again, it was a perfect stay, the the perfect place to shoot!! I will absolutely be back again, and again to stay at this magnificent hotel!",happy
"The room we stayed in was very small infact it was almost impossible to get undressed in the bathroom but the room was very clean and that was more important to us. Location, WELL you could not get better. Half a block to Magnificent mile and about five blocks from Navy Pier. The staff there could not be beat, so helpful and all kinds of knowledge. (Vic you are my hero). Just outside on either corner there is a ---- and a Dunkin Donut mmmmmmmmmmmm. The roof top on the --nd floor was good and a great place to meet people from all over.",happy
Such a great hotel near Central Park. They always upgrade me without asking (for Starwood status) and the suites have amazing views. Both Norma's and the Burger Joint offer top food and even the room service is great. Definitely one of my favorites in New York,happy
"OK, so its reasonably priced for a central location. However, our room was very shabby and dark. A light fitting had fallen apart revealing bare wires, the sheets and carpet were stained and torn, and the curtains were disgusting. The room was also noisy, being close to the main road (Van Ness), and the elevator is a museum piece.
There is no restaurant on-site, and the cafe (part of the same building but separately owned) had closed down, though the receptionist still recommended it!! 
I definitely would NOT come here for a special occasion, and I wouldn't stay there again with my family, but for a cheap back-packers place its OK.
The following night we stayed at the La Quinta near the airport - it was cheaper and far nicer, but out of town!",not happy

Parking is plentiful and it is near major interstate roads. Have no complaints whatsoever. A-C worked well, room was quiet, etc.",happy
"I am now officially WAY over staying in the midtown area in NYC and I think the Upper East Side may be my preferred locale. It's QUIET and you can actually walk the streets at a relatively leisurely pace. The Hotel Wales is in a great spot, --nd and Madison Ave. Near the park and the subway, walking distance to the Met and the Guggenheim. The rooms are quite small. I've stayed in twin rooms twice and they both have been pretty tiny. But for Manhattan, fairly standard., I think The staff seem particularly cheerful, which I think is always a good sign. The only weirdness is that in both rooms, the only mirror is in the bathroom. A small thing but kind of a hassle and so easily fixed!",happy

"The Marriott Courtyard Tremont Hotel is not a bad choice - as long as you don't want to sleep or you're deaf. 
The rooms (I had two) were nothing special but ok, both equipped with modern furniture, flat screen TV and internet access, cleanliness was also ok. The breakfast could be better but is fair.
So far so good but the building has an immense problem with noise exposure. The rooms are extrem clairaudient. You can hear every word you neighbour say (and not even that), every door that falls into the latch, everyone that passes by on the hallway. If you're unlucky and you get a room nearby the elevator be glad on every """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""bing"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" when the door opens. 
But the worst thing is the noise that comes from outside. The hotel is located on a major street in the theater district, surrounded by theaters, discos and cinemas. There are a lot of people in the street the whole night, there's always heavy traffic and hooting seems to be mandatory while driving on Bostons roads. There must be also a hospital in the area, expect to hear ambulances with sirens all night long. And if that wouldn't be even enough, the hotel porter requests taxis by blowing a whistle regardless what time it is, even in the early morning hours- that is --- when you try to sleep after an intercontinental flight. 
I guess there are better and mainly quiter places in downtown Boston. If this hotel is your choise be sure to have ear protection with you. Demand for a room located on the back side and preferable at the end of the hallway.",not happy
"The only reason to stay here is if you don't know any better--but now you'll have no excuse. Our check-in experience was terrible; -- minute wait.

"We stayed at Morgans for three night and we can really recommend it. If you like shopping it's a walking distance to great stores. The included breakfast is a big plus of course.
The minus is that they don't offer free WI-FI and be careful using their cab service. They tried to charge us -- USD for taking us to New Ark airport (taking a yellow cab is about -- USD on a flat rate).",happy
"We had to stay here for almost - weeks while my wife recovered from surgey at a nearby hospital. The sales manager worked with me on a long stay rate and I can say that I am very satisfied with the hotel property and the staff. All of the staff was friendly and accomodating. The shuttle ride from the airport had complimentary water. The hotel has free cookies and newspaper every day. I liked the library in the lobby that allows you to check out and read books. Every morning there was a hot breakfast with eggs bacon or sausage and fruits.
There was an evening reception Mon-Thursday with free beer wine and hot snacks.
There is really not much more you can ask for.
You easily walk to a Pizza place, Thai, Outback, Liquor store and a Mexican restraunt
Excellent stay and the pool and hottub was nice for my daughter.",happy
"My son and I stayed here over spring break. I got a room here at a very good price - almost as low as the cost of a nearby hostel. The room was very clean. I read a few reviews that said the rooms were small, but considering the size of an apartment in NYC, I didn't think it was that small. We had two double beds, and if we had been traveling with a third person, we probably could have squeezed in a rollaway bed. The bathroom was very clean and looked like it had been recently updated. 
A couple of cons - there was no screen on the window. We were on the --th floor and the window opened all the way, but there was no screen or any other safety feature. The bottom of the window is about -.- feet off the floor, so I kept having panic thoughts of my son (who was -- YEARS old at the time) tripping and falling out the window...a little paranoia there. lol However, I would not recommend this for someone traveling with a small child. Also, I could have sworn the rooms were advertised as having air conditioning. This one did not. I'm guessing they put window units in during the summer, but since it was still March, they hadn't put them in yet (it was unseasonably warm while we were there). That's just my guess, anyway.
The other thing that was a little odd was that the door lock looked like it had been broken before. I suppose if someone is really paraniod, this might be an issue. However, they have someone at the front desk -- hours a day. As a matter of fact, when you go out, they ask that you give them your room key and they will give it back when you return. Unheard of in this day, but it was kind of cool because you get to know the front desk people and they get to know you. They will ask for ID if they don't recognize you, but otherwise, they'll just give you your key. Again, I suppose if someone is super paranoid, this might be an issue, but I felt very safe there - more safe than staying at a motel with outside entry in the middle of nowhere. 
Also, if you're not used to sleeping in a noisy city, I would recommend bringing ear plugs. The windows are super thin and you can hear traffic and people ALL NIGHT - it is only a couple of blocks from Time Square, so be prepared for traffic noise. I actually slept with a white noise track on my MP- player all night, and as soon as I dozed off, I didn't notice the noise anymore.
Aside from these small issues, I thought it was a great place, and I would definitely recommend it. They have a couple of nice lobby areas, one of which has a couple of dining tables, as well as a room with large lockers for rent for $-. That was great for us because we checked out at --am, but our flight didn't leave until -pm, so we locked up our luggage, went out to see a few more sights, came back and watched TV in the lobby for a while, then left.
This is a super deal in a great location, and I would highly recommend it.",happy
"From the moment we stepped onto this Hilton property we were treated like valued guests. The valet service was quick and courteous. Without being asked, the valet told us about the shuttle service and other valuable bits of information to make our stay enjoyable.
Robin, at the front desk, greeted us with a smile and a friendly personality. She gave us an upgraded room without asking (as we are Gold HHonors members). She also gave us information about the hotel to make our stay pleasant.
We used bell service at arrival and departure, each time having Victor help us with our luggage. What a professional, courteous man he is. He was at our door within - minutes of calling for bell service on our departure.
Other delightful experiences included a fruit-snack basket delivered to us once we were settled into our room. Also the Executive floor lounge was comfortable and well attended. We had plentiful hors d'oeuvres the first evening, and a great breakfast the next morning. If you wanted, you could make a great meal of either offering. 
As for the accommodations, our room was top notch. Everything was clean, stocked, and beautiful. We had a great view of the Hollywood Hills and Universal Studios. Just wonderful.
This by far was the best stay at a Hilton we've had. I wish our stay were longer. This was a treat and delight. We will be back.",happy

I am going to be out of town for almost a week, which gets really pricy when parking at the airport. I found the Courtyard's Park & Fly feature and am saving half of what I would be paying if I had parked at the airport! As soon as I arrived, the van was ready to take me to the airport so I probably got to the gate faster than if I had parked at the airport's long-term parking lot. The van driver was very nice and accommodating, too, dropping me off right at the curb of my airline (what a great service - especially if it's raining!). Thank you, Courtyard, for this wonderful service! I travel often and I will be utilizing this service again soon!",happy

Cell signal from room is incredibly weak, as well as wireless internet signal strength. Call for your car well in advance of when you need it (-- min vs the ----- advised by the front desk).

Excellent lodging with well maintained grounds. All of the staff and especially Georgiana in the breakfast dining area were very accomodating.

"I stayed here with friends in September and again in December with my boyfriend. Both times my rooms were incredibly clean and the staff was very friendly.

In December we booked through Expedia and was only able to get two twin beds for - nights and - double bed for two nights.

"Spent one night there with my parents, taking them to NYC for the first time. They aren't used to NY hotel prices and set up, and I was really worried we'd get there and it would be tiny and dingy and, well, a typical NY budget hotel. And I think we got lucky in a lot of ways as far as room selection - non-smoking, two Queen beds, not close to an elevator or other noise-maker, free upgrade to a larger room on the -th floor with a view of the Empire State Building. They said they try to give preference on the best rooms to people who book directly through them or their website. And we got there shortly after check-in. In any case, it exceeded all expectations in terms of service, cleanliness, and comfort. Great central location, amazing value.",happy

"My company has been using the Motel Capri for a few years now. It is in a good location for an event we attend every year. We had a pleasant experience in the past and decided to return again this year. Our experience was far from prior ones. 
-. Front desk was horrendously rude. First encounter with them when we arrived at --:--am, they barked at us that check-in wasn't until -:-- and that was that! No welcoming words or offers to store bags, just """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""either you can wait here or come back."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Not a big deal, but a little unpleasant.
-. The room this time was not so nice. There were cigarette burns on the furniture and the bathroom had some issues ....but ok for the price. Dirty carpeting on the floor... 
-. On our exit the same man we encountered upon our arrival, informed us in again an unpleasant manner that keeping our bags for the day for our red-eye home was putting him out and not something he could easily do. In fact, more than - hours was problematic and he simply wouldn't do it despite the fact that they had a system for it in place. So - nights of staying and I couldn't store my bag for a full day until we went to the airport. 
He yelled at me telling me to get out when I decided his tone and language had gone too far. I let him know I had been coming there for some time and my company uses it and I would expect if not service a kinder approach. I guess that is what we get for looking for value.... We spent our last day lugging our bags around town. But before we were sent on our way, the desk guy decided to yell at me when I suggested his services were less than par...he said I had mental problems and more. It was rather funny and horrid at once. My suggestion is don't stay here UNLESS you are willing to accept that $--- a night doesn't make you a valued customer.
Needless to say, we will not be coming back! A little more down the street and you will find nicer options with better rooms and a little service ...which goes a long way!!!",not happy

"I was there in November, and the food at the breakfast buffet was awful and overpriced. The waffles were hard as rocks, the hot food wasn't hot, there was only one type of pastry and it wasn't very good, actually stale, the fruit was tired and the pineapple was sour, the biscuits were not homemade. There was no Texas feel to the food, no Mexican type offerings or salsa. I could have been in any average hotel anywhere. The room had a balcony, but it was so windy, even propping the door open with a chair didn't work, the door kept slamming shut - so much for trying to enjoy the weather. The walking trail was pretty short and not that interesting. The rooms were nice. The actual hotel was large and chopped up and it was a long walk every time I would go from the lobby to the elevators. The lobby seemed dark and depressing, not inviting. It's probably a good place to stay if you are a golfer with money.",not happy

During the two hour decoration time, Loni popped in, ever so often, to offer his help, which when I took him up on it more than once, he did with grace ( which included bringing in more tables for the party) and a smile.

You can even hear the phone ring (loudly) from the room next door and the draft under the door is also pretty impressive (no A-C needed).

When I arrived though - despite my credit card having been charged in April when I booked the room - my reservation could not be found by Ben at the desk.
He took my confirmation letter, headed to the back, came back, apologized for the wait and then programmed our keys. The room was alright - the beds were old, the carpet had some stains, but it was a room. That night, when we needed extra towels, I asked at the desk and they were handed over with a smile.
The next night though, after a day playing tourist, we tried to get back into the room, only to discover that neither key worked. Turns out our keys had only been activated for one of the three nights. It was taken care of at the desk, but it was an inconvenience.
Would I stay there again? It's difficult to stay. The room served its purpose but was without any whistles of bells. It was affordable, and breakfast was included, but I can't really commit either way.",not happy
"We travel to San Francisco once or twice a year and want the best of 
everything. . We just came back from a five nighter and experienced 
another great stay. The nicely furnished room was clean, very bright and 
airy with plenty of room, and the king bed was extremely comfortable. 
The bathroom was furnished with extra large, fluffy thick towels that 
were very soft, not old and scratchy, a hair dryer, and Bath and Body 
products. This was a pleasant surprise and not the usual generic bathroom 
products. The hotel again provides a safe environment, decor, and the ambiance as well as the service were all perfect. If you are looking 
for a hotel which is conveniently located to Union Square, San 
Francisco Shopping Centre, Cable Car turnaround, BART or MUNI METRO 
Station, and-or SF MUNI, stay here. We will never stay any where else. The front desk and elevators are so close to the entrance that you can save your energy for the streets of San Francisco. Everyone on this hotel staff that we came in contact with was caring and helpful, appeared to take great pride in their work, and thanked us for staying at the hotel.",happy
"My wife and I stayed one night at the fairly new JW Marriott in Indianapolis in mid-July. We normally stay at the Conrad what visiting Indy but decided to try out the new hotel. 
The hotel is over-sized - probably -X the size of the Conrad. Almost reminds one of a Vegas-style hotel. The styling of the hotel is very modern-eclectic - it stands in sharp contrast to the more conservative and traditional Conrad styling. I personally prefer the Conrad but I'm sure others will prefer the JW. The JW lobby is loud and busy - Conrad is quiet and reserved.
The service was generally pretty good - however, the luggage did take over -- minutes to get to the room. I finally went down stairs to retrieve the luggage at which point the bell man brought it up. We did not order room service or eat at the restaurants so we got little exposure to the service other than the valet, which was fine.
The room view was spectacular. We were on the top floor and had an end room - two walls with floor to ceiling glass. Amazing. This is one area that the Conrad can not complete with JW - the views. Otherwise, the room was like the lobby - more modern in design. The office chair looks like something from my parents --'s kitchen. Take note: the bathroom does NOT have a tub - least not in our room. Also, the room did not have a couch (which you get at the Conrad) although there is room for one. But overall the room was very nice, beds were comfortable.
The pool is very small - smaller than Conrad and I do not like the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""raised"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" design of the pool. Hot tub was nice sized and the excerise facility was very large. One area where the Conrad is obviously superior to the JW is the changing-shower facilities for the pools and excercise rooms. There is no comparison. Conrad feels like an exclusive golf club with dry-wet sauna, multiple showers, many free amenities etc. The JW feels like a public changing area with no saunas and few free amenities. The Conrad comes equipped with robes and they are nowhere in sight at the JW. 
The presence of a Starbucks in the meetings area is a nice feature.
Overall, the new JW is a great new hotel in Indy but my vote is still that Conrad is a distant first. If you are an executive used to high-end treatment, it's my opinion the JW probably will not quite satisfy like the Conrad.",happy
"I was looking for a hotel with an outdoor pool because I was there during July. Few hotels in NYC have outdoor pools, and the other ones that I found were outrageously expensive. The Thompson LES was a good price and I love the LES. The hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. The pool gets crowded in late afternoon so get there early.",happy
"We traveled by chartered bus from NC to Columbus, OH for our family reunion...long trip (about -- of us including kids, teens, middle-agers, & elderly), but all happy to travel together. Was late when we arrived at the Hawthorn (airport). Worst travel experience I've had in a long time!!! I'll start with the happy ending! The happy ending was when a few of us took it upon ourselves to get the heck out of there and check into a much safer-cleaner hotel for only a few $$$ more which was less than - min away to enjoy the remainder of the weekend. Where do I start about this poor excuse for a hotel? No towels-not enough wash cloths (I had to dry off with a pillow case), smelly rooms, dirty linen & tub, clogged tub, wet carpet, unkept trashy overgrown grounds, holes in exterior doors to rooms, spider webs galore, wobbly boards on steps-porches leading to rooms, insects, wet stains on bed, pair of panties w-a pad left on floor beside bed, inadequate kitchen items, raccoon eating from garbage area, alley cats roaming, drug deals in parking lot, inadequate lighting, manager never returned calls re: numerous complaints, unprofessionally dressed night auditor, rusty shuttlebus, bad-looking surroundings. I was very concerned for all the family members who stayed at this place. I'm not one who typically takes the time to write hotel reviews, but this experience was terrible enough that I felt compelled to do so. The owners-managers of this place need to just face the music and do whatever needs to be done to renovate, update, clean out-clean up, or just shut it down. No Joke, this hotel is not a safe place to stay. Wyndam, this place may eventually ruin your great reputation!!!!",not happy
"Based on the other reviews I read on this property my expectations for this property were pretty high. Don't get me wrong, for a Hampton this is a nice place, but I've stayed at WAY nicer Hampton's in the past. 
My room was a nice size and cleaned very nicely every day, but in need of an update (embedded grime in the bathroom, cracks in various places, etc.). The evening reception is a nice touch if you are ok with nachos and draft beer (not that there's anything wrong with that). The fitness facilities are in DESPERATE need of an update and are among the worst I've seen lately (Hilton rep's if you read this - please, please, please update the fitness facilities at the older Hamptons). The wi-fi was sketchy and dropped me off several times a night.
The area itself is lacking in food and shopping options. There are maybe - or - restaurants at this exit, all of which are fast food. You'll have to drive a few exits down to for a sit down meal and shopping of any sort.
All that said, the staff was very nice and the accomodations were acceptable.",not happy
"A great find in midtown! The hotel was in the perfect location for business (barely a block from the Empire State Building) as well as a little leisure (about -- blocks to Times Square). The staff was extremely friendly, the concierge very helpful. The rooms were small (but normal for Manhattan), but absolutely immaculate. The hotel was clean and safe. Note that the Standard King rooms only have showers - not bathtubs.
Will definitely be staying here on future business and may consider it on my next leisure trip!",happy
"I just completed a --night stay at the Philadelphia Westin. This hotel was picked for me because it was across the street from the building where the office I was visiting was located. Good location for me, but I don't know if I'd pick this spot if I was a tourist. It was nice to be near the food court at the Liberty Place and the other restaurants around within walking distance, but most of the tourist stuff wasn't around where I was located. 
The service was great. Everyone from the front door staff to the folks at the front desk to the people with guest services-room service were very nice. On a couple of different occasions, my room key failed to work, and the staff was great about having new cards programmed for me so I didn't have to wait too long. Prices through room service and down at the restaurant were a little steep, but probably not much different from other big cities. 
In general, I'd say room cleanliness was pretty good. There were a couple of questionable stains on the wall near the bed, as well as a couple on sheets-pillowcases on certain days. Also, there was one day where I found a wash cloth with a red spot. I tossed it on the floor, assuming housekeeping would replace it. The next day when I picked up a new wash cloth from the counter, I found another red spot...surprisinly similar to the one from the previous day. No proof it was indeed the same...but no proof it wasn't.
The heavenly beds are still pretty good...not as fantastic as I remember from my last Westin stay, but since I wasn't getting a ton of sleep at night anyway, it wasn't really mattering much.
I had a corporate rate of $----night, which I guess isn't terrible, but if you're paying much over this, I think I'd look for something in a better part of town with more people out and about at night if that's your thing.",happy
"Stayed here in a -bdrm suite for - nights in November. Overall definitely enjoyed the stay and we thought the staff were excellent.
Likes
- good location, near Main Station and Chrysler Building.
- a la carte breakfast at the restaurant came with the room. Try the chilli spiced hollandaise eggs benedict!
- you can get real coffee in the bar, not the usual stuff you get in America.
- good size room (for Manhattan), with good amenities and technology
- free internet
Dislikes
- the shower head over the bath kept on switching itself back to the bath head
- charging for small things like bottled water
Overall enjoyed the stay and would stay here again. Not so passionate though that I wouldn't stay somewhere else if I could find a good deal elsewhere.",happy
"We chose the Argonaut because we got a great special on Travelzoo for four nights. We arrived around -pm, check in was at -pm but they had a room ready. i highly recommend becoming an In Touch kimpton member, you get special discounts and a $-- credit to raid the mini bar! The room location was initially disappointing we faced another building and the view overlooked a rooftop as well. We asked the desk clerk Sarah for a different room and she readily gave us a room on the third floor over looking a courtyard in the Cannery, excellent! 
The concierge helped us rent a go car which was fun but it was cold that day, if you rent one bring a small blanket to cover your legs will definitely make the ride more enjoyable, I also reccommend buying a muni pass they are about $-- for three days but you get unlimited rides on the cable cars, buses and trolley. A ride on a cable car is $- each way. 
Staff was very friendly, doorman at night was hilarious, room was well kept and clean, would definitely stay there again!",happy
"I was there on business in May so this is a little late. Did have some free time with some colleagues from Houston and went to NASA and a couple of great restaurants (can't remember their names right now). The Houstonian is a beautiful property in its own secluded setting. The lobby is warm, rustic, spacious and elegant. The rooms were fantastic. Service top notch. Got a spa treatment and it was wonderful and relaxing. The spa and fitness center are a must do. There is a walking trail around the property that is great to take advantage of. Tennis courts as well. The pool areas are fun, tropical setting. Can order snack food and drinks at the pool bar. Had breakfast one morning in their restaurant and no complaints, typical hotel breakfast but good. Also had a glass of wine in the bar area one night and perfectly fine as well. The atmosphere and service in both instances were great. I would love to find a reason to come back and stay at the Houstonian. Great for business and a weekend get away. Busy place, seems popular, nice wedding going on while I was there. George Bush Sr.'s old house is on the property and I guess they use it for receptions.",happy
"I stayed here while helping my son get set up as a graduate student at Ohio State. This was a great hotel. The rooms were large and clean, the bed extremely comfortable.

"This is one of those Priceline coups - for those of us who trust Priceline a whole lot more than we should - this must be where they make their money back.

The hotel building itself is OK but not fancy - the lobby is not particularly prepossessing. The staff were very helpful and friendly, couldn't have been more accommodating or kind or willing to help. The room was perfectly adequate, not too weirdly decorated, and everything was clean. The comfy bed had - pillows of different thicknesses which I really appreciated. No smokiness in non-smoking rooms. The continental breakfast was abundant and pretty reasonable of its type, muffins bagels cereal juice coffee. Free WiFi, prompt shuttle service, excellent room price. I had read some unfavorable reviews & was prepared for something bad, but the good staff and physical comfort made it a pleasant stay.",happy
"I just got back from a two day stay at the Fisherman's Wharf Hyatt and while the hotel is in a great location and the staff was extreamly friendly there were issues with the rooms, mostly the bathroom. 
Here's a idea, bathrooms are a tool for your stay they need to provide a function and when it's over designed for visual appeal it looses the function. A two inch deep sink does one thing... it splashes water, most of it on you. As for the shower it has a recessed shower head in the ceiling, I am - --"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and can adjust it my friend is - -"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and she had to get on her tip toes ,someone who is - -"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" or shorter better bring there tooth brush into the shower and poke at it if they want to adjust it. It is also in front of the of the shower handles and the shower door does not slide. This means you have to turn the water on standing under it for a nice blast of cold water until you can dive out of the way or until it's warm enough to get back under. 
Some other things might help this hotel get the - or - rating the would like and that is don't let the city or whoever position a giant dumpster in front of your hotel. Not only is it a eye sore it's very loud when items are thrown into it. There are a lot of places on that street that are not occupied ---- and how about a mini bar?? I know when I booked the room it didn't have one and it didn't bother me from my computor... It did bother me when I wanted a drink when I got to my room.
Overall the rooms were very clean, the staff very nice and the location is great, some small changes and the hotel would be great also. Until then it's just a little above average.",not happy
"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. When we arrived, we were promptly greeted by the valet worker who was very friendly. He had me go over the car to make sure that there weren't any scratches on the car and asked if we needed a luggage cart to our room. The only downside is that valet is $-- per day, but to me it was well worth it and I knew my car was being kept somewhere safe for being in a major city. The lobby was very well decorated, and we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff. He asked us the reason for our stay and I mentioned that we were there for a night out with a group of friends in the area. He even gave us free passes to a local bar at the Power Plant Live area. Our room was very clean and it still smelled like the cleaner when we walked in! The beds were also very comfy. There was a nice sized flat screen TV and the bathroom was also very clean and a deent size. We were attending a concert at Rams Head Live that night, and it was a ---- minute walk there, and it was also very safe. We left Rams Head around -:--AM and walked back with a friend, but it was also very safe to walk back at that time of night as there were plenty of people walking about and it was well lit. We didn't have any problems with noise and slept nicely. The next morning I called down to valet for my car and it was brought to me within -- minutes. The valet worker even provided us with cold bottled water for our ride home and gave me a map with directions on how to get out of the city safely. We were very pleased with our stay. One of the best hotels we've ever stayed in. We will definitely be back when we need to stay in Baltimore!",happy
"We have stayed in the Charlotte area a number of times but never before at the Marriott City Center. The location suited our needs perfectly for this particular trip.
 The check-in and bellman staff was exceptionally courteous and quite efficient. The lobby was attractive and well-maintained. Self-parking in the garage is not difficult once you navigate the very sharp and narrow curve in the entrance ramp. It felt reasonably safe and well lit. Our room was a bit small but certainly clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced given our discount (AAA, AARP, and Marriott- sponsored packages all work out to pretty much the same weekend discount). 
BUT, and here is why I only rate our stay neutral and consider even that somewhat generous:
We were there on Friday and Saturday nights. Friday night we were awakened by extremely loud voices and laughter in the hallway right outside our room on an upper floor. I peeked out the security peephole and saw a group of well-dressed young people. they were calling to each other from doorway to doorway, down the hall, and generally behaving as though they were in a college dorm on a weekend night. I assume we were the unfortunate hallmates of people who had attended a very successful rehearsal dinner or other youth-oriented event where a lot of alcohol had been consumed and the reality of being in a grownup setting had been forgotten. I called the desk to complain and after five minutes the noise subsided somewhat, whether because the celebrants realized their behavior was unacceptable or because someone came up from the desk to tell them to be quiet I do not know.
Saturday night was much worse and something the hotel should have controlled. The relatively unobtrusive thumping music we had heard and ignored in the background Friday night had become a major annoyance, blasting up to our high-floor room for hours. We tried to go to sleep about --:--; it continued until after - a.m. Several times between - a.m. and - a.m. I called the desk and was told various things, among them that there had once been a club nearby that caused noise problems and the problem had just reappeared.... they were sending someone across the street to complain to the club...not clear if they were calling police, Not quite clear how many other people if any had called to complain this particular night, It was as loud as if we were on the street right outside the club--but keep in mind that not only were we on a high floor, we had our windows closed, and the air conditioning was on. 
I suppose that on a week night for business travelers the Marriott Ceity Center is still a viable option, but I don't know the club habits of Charlotte--perhaps even on a week night there might be an issue. Unless I were to be told with certainty that the club noise was no longer an issue I would not stay at this Marriott again despite its excellent location. I am also disappointed that although my husband included a comment about the excessive noise and poor response from staff in his response to the standard """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""how was your visit"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" survey he received upon our return home, we have received no reply or acknowledgment of any kind--nearly a month after the survey was returned.",not happy

Lovely staff, we were upgraded to a - bedroom suite with full kitchen, dining room, living area - bedrooms and a bath.. it was a well sized apartment. They guided us through the area with a map outlining restaurants and personal notes about each one. Located a block from the popular Haight Street, and right across from the Golden Gate Park. Very nice continental breakfast as well as organizing the airport town car for us. (p.s. the vegetarian indian restaurant New Ganges a few blocks away was such a wonderful experience!) Would definitely revisit Stanyan!",happy

"I was in doubt as whether to give - or - stars to this hotel, because it excels in some points but may use some renovation. 
Arrival: the lobby is marvelous. With the cascade, foliage and lake, really nice. Coi fishes require a lot of care, so it gives you a measure of how well it has to be maintained in order for the fishes to grow, and they seemed in good shape. The girls at the reception and all other services were extremely friendly and all of our small issues were well attended. A+
Room: The room was facing the garden, basically it faced a palm tree but it was ok, it provided good shade and kept the place cooler. All amenities were available in the room. Bathroom was ok. But we had to move some furniture (my little one tends to fall from the bed so we always need to create some barriers around his side of the bed) and we noticed that behind furniture the vacuum cleaner had not been used in quite a while. Daily cleaning was done, but from time to time you have to dust behind the beds too!! That took some points off. Also rooms start being worn out a bit, although this is not a big issue in my opinion.
Premises: very nice. We did not use the pool as kids liked the beach (see previous review for details), it was clean and calm (at least in the morning). Overall it is all well kept and clean.
We had breakfast at the restaurant and it was fine. We were away most of the day so you may want to refer to other reviews for local activities. 
I have to add that it is well located, in -- minutes (driving) you can reach almost anything, which was the main reason of picking this hotel instead of the Coronado Loews. We did not regret the choice. It is placed in a friendly neighborhood too.",not happy

Then, when we checked in (we'd purchased our room on Priceline for only $--- for a weeknight, so the value was great), there was no lineup. It was after our dinner out and --:--pm so that probably accounted for the lack of lineup.

One tip, if you are leaving to go to O'Hare in the afternoon, take the Red Line subway to the Blue Line subway. Its a lot faster and it only costs $-.--.

"In March this year, I booked a - night stay at this hotel - I clearly specified a non-smoking room (since I am asthmatic). I spent a distressing and uncomfortable first night, due to the overpoweringly unpleasant musty smell of the room. But it was next morning that I found that all rooms on that floor were for smokers. Indeed there was a California State notice on the back of the door warning guests of the health risks of sleeping in the room.
The next morning I requested (and was given) a different room for the remaining - nights.
When I asked why I wasn't allocated a non-smoking room when this had been booked - months earlier, the counter clerk responded - """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""It hadn't been possible to allocate rooms so far in advance"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".

"Loved the Sofitel!!!! It was a wonderful experience. Very convenient, central location to it all. The hotel staff was professional, friendly, and most helpful (they even spoke in French...fun!). The staff accomodated our special request for an early check-in. A room was waiting and available upon arrival. The hotel is immaculate and just as pictured. We could not get over how comfortable the beds were. For being such a central location, there was no street noise. We did a lot of research before booking. This was our first time staying overnight in NYC and we were overwlemed by all of the hotel choices. I have to say we were anything, but disappointed. It was truly wonderful. The only downside...did not care for the Gaby restaurant at all. We wanted to relax and have a drink before ending the evening. The music played at the bar was loud and didn't really match the atmosphere. We went back the next morning because we had breakfast vouchers. We were a party of four with only two vouchers. A scone was $-, pancakes were like $--. We would have been better off grabbing something from Starbucks instead. Even with the two vouchers, the breakfast bill was outrageous for the fare. Next time, we'll skip the Gaby.",happy
"Being located so close to the airport, I expected to hear some sounds from planes landing and taking off. That wasn't the case.

My biggest problem and one of the reasons they lose a star is because I placed the do not disturb sign up, and the maids still came in and cleaned. They did this - or - days in a row. If I pay for a room and place a sign up that says do not disturb, I expect them to respect it. The maid was Asian and spoke almost no English, so I assume she couldn't read the sign either. Right across the street is Brenda's soul food . There is never any wait for one person even if there is an hour wait. I brought two different friends by, and since the door locks to the elevator and she buzzes you in after she identifies you, she needs an I'd from any visitor's . This is a little bit of a hassle, and she reserves the right to refuse a guest from entrance. Although she didn't with me, she could possibly not like your guest and deny them entrance. I asked if they had hot water, an
D they gave me a hot water pot and plug leith - green tea bags... Nice. There isn't any coffee , fridge, microwave or continental breakfast, but it was only --$ a night for me and with nothing else available that was decent for less than ---$ last minute it worked fine. The manger Jane was very nice, but she must live there with her dog, because every time I go in and out the hotel there she is standing out front, like she is guarding the hotel. I felt like I was renting a room from a nosy landlord kind of, she was nice and the place was too, it was just a feeling I had. There was free wifi, which was fairly quick, but it automatically bumps you off like every -- minutes and then you have to log back in all over. It was a little annoying. The bathroom also was very ready to have the floors ripped out and replaced with tile( they were linoleum.) albeit was kept clean.
Upon leaving I was running late for the train back to the airport. I asked the manager Jane when I was checking out if I could take a cab to the train would be better than walking - blocks. she calls a cab she knows, and she says yea it is too close. And starts to kind of lecture me that I should have left earlier( obviously I'm know ) I'm running late and need to pay and leave, but she is lecturing me still. Finally I asked if I could pay and leave. She took my credit card and gave me a bag of ghiriadelli chocolates upon check out.
 I would stay again, but I will probably check others first",happy
"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Omni San Francisco May -----st. We had a wonderful stay and I could not recommend this hotel more highly! The room was beautiful and spacious and extermely clean. I have never stayed in hotel room more spotless than this one. Even our spare toilet paper roll was wrapped in pink ribbon!!
The doormen were always at the ready to open the door or help if you had any questions. The service here is impeccable. We had a problem with our toilet one night and the service person arrived in less than - minutes and had it fixed immediately. 
The location of this hotel is perfect. It's away from the hustle and bustle of Fisherman's wharf and the seedier Union Square. We rented a car and were glad we did as the lines for the cable cars were extremely long-being a holiday weekend. To avoid paying for parking, if you are there on a weekend and have the patience to find a spot, you can park overnight on the street if your meter isn't chargeable on weekends. Otherwise, if you park one block up at the St Mary's garage, it's about $--.-----which beats the $-- you have to pay to park at the hotel.
I recommend this property to anyone who is going to San Francisco. EXCELLENT hotel and will absolutely stay here again!!",happy
"Lovely indoor pool area, looks like a lodge. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean, very comfortable and spacious, with minimal noise from outside (you could hear planes, but only if you really listened for them). The breakfast buffet was good value with great coffee (Starbucks), but the omelet chef did not have the slightest clue as to what he was doing. I got more of a scramble than an omelet, and he might have put all of three spinach leaves in the whole thing, which cooked down to nothing. I booked a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cars eat free"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" package which included parking and a $-- gas card - if they still have this deal it is worth it. Overall a very good experience.",happy
"I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again, myself. I always say that it's the little things that count in evaluating hotels. Free internet access is one of those little things that can make an impact on your stay. Hard Rock understands that. Why can't other upscale hotels understand that since it's such big part of everyone's professional and personal lives? When I checked in, a better room was available and I was given a free upgrade (another one of those """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""little things""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""). The front desk staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming.
The location is perfect - just a few blocks away from Michigan Ave. but far enough away from it that you don't have to deal with the noise and lack of cabs. The hotel is also within walking distance of the Clark-Lake el station. The rooms are spacious, spotless and modern. Mine happened to offer the best views of the city (facing north).
Overall, a great night's stay!",happy
"I've stayed at this hotel several times for business over the years. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a romantic weekend getaway, it's fine as a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""functional"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" hotel for business travelers. 
Pros: One of the better locations in downtown Austin. You're within reasonable walking distance of South Congress restaurants and trailers and the -th street entertainment district. As a runner, it's awesome to basically be a staircase away from the Town Lake hike and bike trail. The views aren't bad: capital building on the downtown side and, if you're up high enough, Town Lake on the south side. 
The rooms could use updating, but are clean. I had about -- HD channels on my flat screen. There was a small workspace. Housecleaning did a good job during my --night stay. 
Cons: I'm reimbursed, but if forced to pay $-- a night for parking out of my pocket, would stay at a different hotel. The wi fi is $-- bucks a night with poor coverage. They do have a computer downstairs behind the concierge if you need to hop online for a few minutes. 
Overall I choose this hotel because of the location, friendly staff, and I get a good night's sleep on their beds.",happy
"We stayed at the W Hollywood recently for a large-scale event we were having nearby. While we were running around managing logistics, Karen Daily and her team were behind the scenes helping us greet our clients with a smile and a bottle of champagne. The service, grounds, and overall experience were fantastic thanks to all of the people that make this hotel tick. We're back in LA every month or two, and undoubtedly, will call this location our home away from home. Thanks Karen!!",happy
"The Argonaut is located in Fisherman's Wharf by the water. It is charming with a cool nautical theme and a great staff. The hotel is very accommodating. We booked rooms for a short two night stay but then decided to spend our second night in Napa. The hotel desk staff graciously canceled our second night without penalty. We reserved two rooms, an interior queen and a deluxe room. The queen, as expected, was very small although the decor made up for the size. The deluxe room had a 'view' but unfortunately our window looked into the scaffolding of the building across the street. When you stay there, request a higher floor (-rd or higher) facing the water. Also, the Argonaut offers a lot of 'package' deals. If you are driving a car, check out the deals that come with parking. The hotel charges $-- a night for parking (I parked on the street to save the charge and the bellman still walked over to my car and helped me with my bags. Gotta love this hotel). A rate that includes parking is often a better option than a regular room rate (the packages also include breakfast etc). Fisherman's Wharf is one big tourist trap so the area is deserted at night.. but you can get to other neighborhoods quickly. Avoid eating in the area.. food is not great and charges are high. Snag a cab or the cable car to another neighborhood and get a great meal for a lot less. During the day, its an interesting area to walk around.. and again, you can grab a cable car and visit other neighborhoods. 
I am a big fan of the Kimpton hotels and this ia a great one. The decor makes it a lot of fun. I'd recommend it and I'll plan to stay there again in the future.",happy
"I went on a --night business trip to Chicago and my hotel was booked for me. I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the hotel. Once checked in, I was given a king size room on the --th floor. The view is awesome and I loved the --"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" plasma flat screen tv. The bathroom had plenty of towels and tolietries for one night. There was a small mini fridge and liquors on the dresser- nice touch but pricey- $- for an oj! 
Our group met back down at the Crimson Lounge. I liked the music- atmosphere, but a lady came around wanting us to purchase the table for the night. Umm... they were not that busy or that good. The bar was just as good. 
The hotel is in an area with lots of night life and is a quick taxi ride to anywhere in the downtown area. House of Blues was next door and we didn't have to pay a cover since we checked it out near closing time, awesome blues. 
I had a newspaper at my door early the next morning (before -am). Check-out was a breeze and a billowy white curtains in the entrance was a nice touch.",happy
"A decent hotel in a great location - just a few minutes walk to the shops and some great restaurants and about -- minutes from Pike Place and the waterfront. 
Rooms are big and I had a great view out to the water. Very clean hotel & friendly staff. Amenities are quite basic but for the price and location I would definitely recommend.",happy
"Had one night in this hotel on the way back from Europe. The public areas and rooms are exquisitely decorated and the staff are incredibly polite and well-trained. The bar and restaurant are being remodelled but the concierge insisted on walking me to the temporary space for these (in itself, elegant) and introducing me to the staff so they would understand precisely what I needed. And the gym is superb! Modern, well-lit, and made exercising a pleasure. I would definitely return - the only possible downside was the very noisy air-conditioner, but I was so tired from traveling I would have slept through a hurricane.",happy
"I booked a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""European style"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room at this hotel through Expedia because it was the cheapest find for the location. After booking I started reading the reviews and was very nervous about my choice, but there was nothing to do because the deposit was non-refundable. I needn't have worried; our stay was absolutely fine. Yes, there is truth to the bad reviews -- the rooms are small, the bathroom tile is somewhat dingy (though clean), the air conditioning wasn't impeccable.. but it was adorable and comfortable and clean and quiet and fantastically located and completely suitable for our weekend. The bed and pillows were comfortable, the shower was excellent, and all the staff we dealt with were extremely friendly. 
So really, this hotel is all about your expectations. Those who expected a --star completely modern room would inevitably be disappointed, but for us, who expected a small but functional room in a beautiful old hotel for an excellent city price, this was a great choice. I never write reviews but just wanted to comfort anyone who might be as terrified by the awful reviews here as I was!",not happy
"We recently stayed for one night here. The hotel appears to be a renovated, retouched older property and most likely needs another touch-up. Its main attraction is that it is close to the baseball stadium and Inner Harbor - within walking distance or a short taxi ride. Rooms are standard size which look smaller than they are because of the massive furniture which has seen better days. The bathroom is European size cozy. However, bathroom towels and all the linen is clean and fresh. The bed and the mattress are very comfortable for a good night's sleep; and it is quiet. The staff is quite pleasant too.",not happy

The location is great, and I find it very easy to drive in, check in and have the Union Square location right out the door.",happy
"We paid $--- per night for this hotel and I must say, it was not worth it. When I saw pictures of the hotel lobby online, I figured it would be an amazing hotel with wonderful rooms. This was not the case. The rooms were dated, with approximately ----'s window treatments. Carpets in rooms and hallways were not plush or cozy. Also, the lighting in the room and hallways was dark. My expectations for Hilton were very high, as I have never had a bad experience till now. We paid $--- for night, through Priceline. I am sure it is far more expensive directly through Hilton. It is not worth the money. Go for the Hilton Chicago near the Magnificent Mile instead.",not happy
"There was nothing really wrong with the Grand Hyatt San Antonio but not much was memorable either. Happened to stay at the Hyatt Regency Riverwalk on the same trip and I would choose that Hyatt over this one hands down. If I hadn't compared the two Hyatts back to back, perhaps I would have looked on the Grand more favorably. 
Service at the Grand Hyatt was friendly, provided the staff weren't overwhelmed by crowds. They did automatically offer and accommodate a late checkout, a positive that seems to have become a trend with the chain for loyalty club members. The lobby was generally very busy and loud but not laid out or furnished in a manner to encourage people-watching. The hotel location is great if attending a convention and still pretty good for any other downtown or riverwalk activities with a few blocks of walking. The staff of the main restaurant were too flustered to acknowledge my presence at the time I tried to visit so I gave up and thus can't review the food. 
My room on the --th floor had a nice view but the furniture was a bit worn and about average for a business hotel and below average for a Hyatt though the style fit the Hyatt brand. All I could get was two double beds and no upgrade for loyalty status. One mattress sagged significantly but the two doubles proved helpful when I switched to the other bed for dramatically improved comfort. 
In the end, the Grand paled in comparison to the other Hyatt downtown, other Hyatts I've stayed at and other competitors in town despite a price tag that seems to be higher. There was no reason to flee this hotel but I didn't find much to draw me back to this location either.",not happy
"This was our second time staying at MP. This time we had - dbl bed room on the --th floor. Room was small, but had what we needed. Clean linens, comfy beds, and a safe. Who needs a coffee maker when European Cafe is right down the street on -th. Only unfortunate thing is that the view was --feet from another room, oh well great shades. 
Check in was fine, we got there early and had to leave our luggage in the manned holding room. Usually there was an employee by the elevators so we did feel safe. It is a great (for NYC) value for our time there, I am looking forward when the renovations are done, just hope the prices don't go way up.
The only bad part of our stay came at the end. The doorman was tryiing to get us in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""his"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" taxi and when we headed to the one we preordered he got mad and dropped the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""F"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" bomb, we were - females, usually don't find that with the employees.

"Over Memorial weekend, we stayed at the Washington Marriott Wardman Park. Overall the hotel was fairly clean, recently updated and was extremely easy to get to. The location is right next to the Wooley Park metro station. The room was recently renovated, and upon first glance the hotel room looked very clean. However upon further inspection, I noticed stray hairs in the bathtub and under the sink. I was disappointed when I opened a cabinet door that looked like it would contain a refrigerator and there was just a giant cabinet. The room did have a -- inch flat screen TV…definitely not HD. Although, the Marriott website advertises that all rooms have HBO, this channel did not come through on our TV. 
My biggest surprise was how many families were staying at the hotel (maybe due to the proximity to the zoo). I would highly recommend that the Marriott put families and business travelers on different floors, as families tend to be noisier and be awake at different hours than business travelers. A screaming child in the hallway disturbed our slumber at a ridiculously early hour two days in a row. 
At then end of the trip, I would say there was nothing to big to complain about and nothing so great to write home about.",not happy
"Three of us came to Denver and ended up staying here when the lease on our apartment fell through. After a -- hour drive and a broken down budget rental van, we just wanted a shower and a comfortable bed. We were traveling with a dog and a cat. They took the animals with no problem and no extra fees. We ended up having to extend it from one night to - and that was absolutely no more than a call to the front office. Unfortunately when we tried to e-tend to te - and -th days, they had no rooms available. 
They were romdeling the first and second floors but we heard no noises during the night. They are a little hard to find considering they have no sign on the main road. They are directly behind the panera bread. They have a small parking lot and it filed up during the night. 
The room was very comfortable with a pullout sofa bed in a seperate room from the king size bedroom. The closet was large, as was the counter top next to the sink. The shower curtain is so short that it kept flipping out of the tub when I was taking my shower. I ended up folding the bathroom. They don't have a towel rack near the sink which I thought was odd. They had a hot tub that was open but we didn't have our suits. They have a managers reception for free beer and wine on Mon through Thurs night. The location here is really good. There are a few decent places right outsi de the door to eat. The only thing that could have made it better would be a Walgreens next door.",happy
"Spent one night here before going on cruise on Friday, Sept --th. I was excited to try The W, as it always seemed very intriguing. It was just okay... The location was convenient, as it was near to Pike Street, but the guest service was nothing to talk about. Just fake, plastic smiles that seem quite robotic. No help with my I-phone cell phone charger, as I forgot it home. When I asked, the response I received was just, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""no, can't help you"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".

"This hotel is certainly above average, but I don't find it particularly exciting. The room was usual and clean. Service was not as great as I hoped with front desk staff giving the incorrect hours of room service and when I ordered room service delivery on the electronic system they have for that it never came, no one ever called to inform me that in fact the service closed an hour before the front desk staff had informed me. I had the same problem with the restaurant and they would not seat us for breakfast, (and I had purchased breakfast with the room) because they were going to be closing in -- minutes. While I thought that would be enough time to eat some breakfast, apparently they were unwilling to prepare it with only -- minutes to go before it closed. The lobby is not set up in a way as to be an enjoyable place to stay or people watch and the library room there while lovely to look at has a mold problem. Being highly allergic to mold myself I had to try a couple of rooms and take the allergy free room as the whole lobby, restaurant, library and rooms do seem to have a mold problem.

From the roof access you can even see the bridge and take picures of it in the sunset.

"I stayed for - nights in July. I had originally booked another hotel further up, but it was getting progressively worse reviews on Trip Advisor, so I decided to change to the Chancellor. On arrival I was immediately glad for the switch. It was a short walk up Powell from the BART station, so a very quick and affordable direct trip from the airport. The hotel staff were friendly, helpful and efficient. The hotel itself had a charming and welcoming atmosphere. I felt very safe and comfortable here which is important as a solo female traveller. The room was lovely, decorated tastefully, had a jar of sweets and a very comfortable bed! Brilliant location with easy access to shopping on Union Square, dining options and transport. SF is a great walking city even with all the hills and I enjoyed a big loop walk down Sutter, Market to Embarcadero and then onto Fisherman's Wharf and back the same way.

The clerk at the reception desk said that the manager would be adjusting my bill due to the inconvenience. This didn't happen.

"So of course, this hotel looks great in pictures, but in actuality, it is completely opposite. According to the price (the price is high), this Hotel is a rip off. Granted the location is not bad, and is close to my business conference, but the rooms are in terrible condition. The bathroom is gross!!! It looks like a -- year old bathroom with cracks everywhere, and a very small tub-shower. The jacuzzi was dirty and seemed like it wasn't cleaned for months. The hotel staff was not very helpful when I asked for directions and told them about the condition of their rooms. They pretty much didn't care.
I read the reviews and thought for a while if whether I should believe the good ones or the bad ones, but I regret believing the good ones. I should've gone with the few reviews below me that spoke the truth about this hotel. I would've saved a lot of money if I just stayed at a nearby hotel I searched (which was much nicer and cheaper).

We stayed in room --- and the housekeeping was excellent, room was made while we were out for breakfast and turned down while at dinner.

"Travelled from UK and arrived at Holiday Inn about -.-- in the evening. Check-in was fairly quick but desk staff were rather abrupt. The room itself was clean and tidy however as the room was located near the junction of two roads and two sets of traffic lights the lack of soundproofing was apparent when we entered the room, we believed however that the traffic noise may ease as the evening drew on - WRONG...My family and I were not able to get any sleep due to the constant road noise which rather than getting better later as we had anticipated just got worse - we could hear car radios as they sat at the junction amongst other general traffic noise and road cleaning etc. Quite clearly the soundproofing to the room is inadequate and not the sort of night anyone who has travelled the distance we had wants on their first night in the US.
The next morning my husband complained about the noise and the receptionist said she could move us to another room. We moved to the other room in the morning and then went out as we had travel plans for that day. Upon returning to the room we could hear noise once again - can you believe it we had been put over what I can only imagine was the air conditioning generator or similar, there was a constant noise all night long....how glad were we that we did not have to spend another night here.
Whilst the hotel was clean and tidy and the rooms were adequate we felt very upset that we had been treated so badly. After complaining about the noise on the first night we thought that the staff would have tried at least to give us a room with no noise or even an upgrade but no they did the complete opposite and put us back in the same position.
I would not recommend this hotel for the above reasons and whilst the location to Fishermans Wharf is handy a good nights sleep is more preferable I am sure to anyone. I would love to hear the managements comments as to why they thought it was acceptable to treat us this way. Do not book if you want sleep!",not happy
"I have stayed at other Four Points Sheratons with great pleasure. But this one was just disgusting. Nobody attending the front desk... crowded kibby with people watching TV... the bellman was rude, the hallways and rooms were under repair or rennovation... many people trying to switch rooms because theirs, as ours, were horrible. And the manager just said: Sorry, there's nothing I can do. Our room (reserved quite in advance) was in the last corner of the hotel, with a view of the parking lot, small, smelly, with no toiletries. Oh well, I will never stay at another of these htoels in my life. disappointing. I moved to teh Westin.",not happy
"Wow i had so much fun, there was some great staff at the desk. i think the girl's name was Naadie, so genuine,pretty smile, helped me with my printing, suggestions about restaurants and aloyt more. u all should check out this hotel.",happy
"We had to go to Dallas on a last minute business trip and after searching for hours to find a pet-friendly hotel, we settled on the LaQuinta. Most hotels in Dallas wanted a $---$--- NON-REFUNDABLE deposit. Not only did they accept all - of my welsh corgis, they didn't require a pet fee or deposit. We were also very impressed with the hotel location, (close to many good restaurants, plus the Galleria), cleanliness and comfort of the King Suite.
The staff was very courteous and friendly, and the breakfast was average: cereal, toast, bagels, juice, waffles, yogurt, coffee, etc.
Only thing negative was the aiplanes. However, I didn't find them too bothersome, and slept very well. We will definately stay here again!",happy
"We took the Amtrak train into Chicago for a get-a-way weekend. We are not real familiar with the Chicago downtown area so we were relieved to find that we were close to both the CTA trains and buses, making it easy to get around town to the places we wanted to visit. We were also surprised at the delightful suite we stayed in at this hotel. It had a beautiful view of the city, a full kitchen,bath, sitting area with a flat screen TV, and a separate bedroom that also had a large flat screen TV and a very comfortable queen-size bed. The staff was very friendly but they were not especially informative with how to get around Chicago. They googled everything on the computer and we found that we were able to get around better on our own by walking and being adventurous. The complimentary breakfast did not have the best variety we had ever had, but it was tasty and sufficient to start our morning. Our overall experience was a good one and we would definitely stay again next time we are in Chicago!",happy
We had a week to visit old friends and revisit our favorite places in the City. The Inn was a perfect place for this. The staff was outstanding and made every effort to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable--from checking in to the warm cookies in the afternoon. Very charming place to stay. The restaurant is lovely and comfortable. The menu is impressive and the continental breakfast is a perfect touch. Would definitely recommend it as a romantic getaway.,happy
"Stayed here for - nights in late May - early June, a -- yr old Brit travelling for work. Chose the location to be handy for work (lower Manhattan during the day) and for socialising & sightseeing in midtown and the neighbourhoods.
It was fine and met all of my expectations - the staff were friendly and very welcoming; the room was clean and comfy; the bed was very comfortable and the air was breathable; and the location was just what I needed.
It is a slightly out of the way corner and if you're new to NY you might be a bit spooked by the environment in the nearby block or two, since there are wholesale flower warehouses, downmarket shops and at the moment there is lots of construction going on. In fact, it's not at all a seedy or 'low rent' neighbourhood and when you walk half a block over to -th or -th avenue you feel part of the city again - don't be put off!
I didn't try any of the food except for breakfast on the first day, which was pretty much as you'd expect, and politely served. The 'pantry' was a good idea - if you're a Brit shaking off the time difference you can stock up on snack food to keep you going when you wake up at -am!
Used it as a base for travelling to Central Park, Greenwich Village, Soho, Downtown, Long Island (via Penn station just a few min walk away) - very practical and fun location. 
The complimentary wifi worked fine for me but not for my colleague.",happy
"I stayed here in November ---- for a conference at the Hilto-n across the street. The hotel is a short four block walk from the Dupont Circle Metro station on the red line. It took me about -- minutes to get there on the Metro (with one transfer from the yellow line) from Reagen airport. Easy as pie. The hotel is located in the thick of cool restaurants, coffee shops, stores (including liquor stores), and limited grocery types of places. The walk to and from the Metro is pleasant with folks walking their dogs, dining at restaurants, and generally just hanging out in the area. I was approached by a presumably homeless person once, which is to be expected in any city. The hotel staff was really friendly and let me check in a little early. I reserved a King bed for myself and it was comfortable with a million pillows and nice sheets and comforter..The room was rather small and without a desk but the bathroom was huge and clean. The water pressure was very low in the shower but who really cares. The elevators are very small but have a nice classic feel as does the rest of the hotel. The lobby is small and I didn't try the restaurant but the open computer access was great. It's a nice place to stay for about any reason, especially the deal I got through expedia, which was $--- for three nights.",happy
"In town for the L.A. Marathon, used priceline and rec'd a great deal!! Room was beautiful, but parking was --.-- per day..ouch. The staff was attentive. Had dinner at the hotel and food wasn't that great, but service was excellent. Before going down for dinner, we decided what we would have based on the room service menu. For whatever reason, the bar area didn't serve the same menu as the room service?? ONE BIG PROBLEM** went to leave for the marathon at -:-- a.m., hotel valet brought the car around and I got into the drivers seat..had to jump out.. HE ACTUALLY FARTED IN THE CAR..IT WAS SO GROSS AND I WAS BEYOND MAD!! It didn't go away for a long time..had to shampoo the car seat..NOT KIDDING.",happy
"Having made a reservation some - months prior to arrival, I was delighted that the Staybridge Suites honoured my request for my room to be as high as possible, to complement the pre booked King room with view. Our room was on the --th floor with fantastic views of the Manhattan Skyline. The room, although slightly smaller than other Staybridge Suites we have stayed in, fulfilled all our needs over the - night stay, with a comfortable bed, quality bedding, and the availability of a small but very useful kitchenette. Location is excellent, with easy access to Subway and bus transport. Any doubts about the sleazier elements of the area are not a major concern. Yes, there are some, but there are far more elsewhere – even in the Times Square vicinity, and --th Street in front of the hotel is perfectly safe, if a little run down and crowded. The Port Authority Bus Station opposite is busy, but the buses arrive and depart well away from the hotel, and inside the complex are numerous fast food places, a pub, post office and a CVS outlet. Good and plentiful breakfasts are offered by the hotel, with a fitness suite located in the basement to ward off those extra pounds. All in all, the Staybridge Suites offer a fantastic package of location, comfort and value at the heart of New York. Why go anywhere else?",happy
Terrible!!! Room was not clean... Staff was rude and and not attentive. Will never go back...,not happy
"The hotel staff really made our stay. They answered a million questions, gave great dining recommendations, and were generally accomodating (quickly emptying our minibar so we could actually use the fridge for food, bringing hot water for tea before room service hours began). The rooms are typical New York size. Our room was on the front of the hotel on the sixth floor, and we had no issues with street noise, as the hotel is on a side street. It's in the midst of the flower district, which makes for a lovely stroll to the Starbucks around the corner for morning coffee. The shower had a partial glass wall and no curtain or door, which I dislike, as it makes for a chilly shower and water on the floor. Otherwise, the bathroom was well-appointed. The restaurant was a bit of a disappointment, but we were in NY, so plenty of other options.",happy
"Stayed here on a business trip in may. Took a redeye in, but they gave me early check-in in a super-quiet room on the first floor (which is below sidewalk level, and well - quiet). I slept like a rock! The staff universally displayed a great service-oriented attitude - really like that. Hosted wine hour was fun, too. Highly recommend this one.",happy
"We stayed here due to the location to the Inner Harbor and Camden Yards. It was well worth the stay and would stay here in the future as well. Rooms were very clean, staff was very helpful as well as the doorman. Breakfast buffet was a hit with the family and had a good selection of items to please everyone. The parking is in the parking garage which is behind the hotel, $--.-- for a -- hour stay. If you get your ticket stamped at the front desk you are able to come and go into the garage w-o extra charge.",happy
"e and a close friend stayed at the hotel recently over the weekend of June --,----. After a long a trip from central california up to the bay area, I went up to the front desk and wanted into to check into my room. As I arrived to the front desk, a hotel associated asked me some questions. She asked me for my credit card on file. I currently have a mastercard debit card that used to book the room. She then, swiped the card, and asked me, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""how much do you have on here?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I told her, less than -- dollars. I wasn't sure why she was asking me this. So now, all of the sudden she tells me that the hotel charges --- dollars a NIGHT for any incidental fees. (I booked the room for two nights) I was completely blow away with that statement. I had already booked the room WELL IN ADVANCE (Back in MARCH in be precise) and i didn't have any spending extra spending money on my card.
I told the hotel associate that """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I was completely unaware of that, I thought that booking in advance was enough"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" She then NEGOTIATE some sort of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""plea bargain"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". She stated that because I had booked the room in advance, she would only charge me --- dollars and not --- dollars for the incidental fees.
Told her """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Let me make some phone calls, and i'll come back up to the front desk."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" The hotel associate insisted that one of the other associates hold my bags for me. So I gave her my bags.
After making some phone calls, I went back up to the front desk, and the associate that previously helped went on """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""break"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". I was persistent that I needed to speak with her again. One of the lobby attendants went outside to locate her. He came back and told me """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" the next associate will be happy to help you. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
So I went up to the desk again, and explained my situation. as I was explaining this; the new associate looked at me will a puzzled look. She then stated """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" the incidental fee, is a one time set fee of --- dollars. you don't pay that fee per night, that you stay here"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" so then she swiped my card, and she gave me my room key. I was so happy that I had finally got my room key, for a room that I had paid for well in ADVANCE. My friend was even calling around for other hotels just to see if anything was available; and being that it was PRIDE weekend, no other room were available.
You may think this is the end of my story but it's not.
I was so tired and exhausted for STRESSING about my getting room, that I had forgotten to retrieve my bags. So I went back to the front and asked for my bags. *SIGH* A lobby attendance approached me, and I told him """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" oh I need to get my bags"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" He then asked """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" do you have a baggage claim ticket."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I told him """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""no, the hotel front desk insisted apon taking our bags. when i went to make that phone call that is when they took them.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""oh, so you need to speak to a manager"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" He stated.
After a few minutes he walked out with my bags. FINALLY. and then he asked """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""would you like me to take them to your room?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I told him """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sure"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I was fed up with the hotel and staff by now.
So he brought the bags up to my room, and that was it.
Due to the these experiences I don't suggest you stay this hotel. Along with the following reasons.
-. NO FREE WIFI IN ROOMS. only in the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""living room or club area"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" of hotel
-. INCIDENTAL FEE OF --- DOLLARS. This policy was not stated whatsoever on the hotel's website. If it was there, I wouldn't have stayed here.
-. LOCATION. It is nowhere near the ballpark. The reason i stayed at this hotel is because I wanted a close hotel near the ballpark for VANS WARPED TOUR ----.

"My husband and I stayed one night. The electronic key system was down. The desk said they would slip one under the door at night when it was ready. They never did. the entire -- hours we had no key. Very annoying. We are gold members through starwood, I was told the morning of our checkin that our room would be ready and that at the off chance it wasn't ready they would have a room for me. Our room wasn't ready. They let me use the spa to change, but my husband had to wait in the lobby and it just wasn't as comfortable and private as I would have hoped. Especially since I was told our room would be ready. Our room was clean and average, but we did have a nice corner room. The size was ok. You just can't expect gigantic space in NYC, I know because I lived there for years. But it was clean, I think the most important hotel room feature. The staff was VERY busy, a hustle and bustle place with a nice lounge-bar at street level. The woman that checked us out was apologetic that we were never given a key and made it up to us through hotel points. I would stay here again, but I know not to expect Four Seasons quality catering.",not happy

"We stayed one night on August -rd at the end of our family vacation. We had two rooms with one of them an upgraded corner room on the --th floor. We stayed there in order to walk to a baseball game. We had a special rate for a Visa promotion that saved us --%, but still paid $--- per room.
Overall, the hotel is very nice - mainly since it's new. Rooms are nice, but aren't anything special. The view was fantastic.
Things started out poorly when we drove up and the Valet parking guy wouldn't take our car. He was too busy. So, we self parked - which is cheaper and easier than the valet anyway.
Check in went smoothly. Rooms were ready a little early. The rooms are average sized. The beds-pillows are nice. Our main complaint was that housekeeping knocked on the door at -:--am. We forgot to put out our privacy card on the door, so I could understand that. BUT, they called - times between -:-- and --:-- and hung up. I know it was housekeeping because the did the same thing to my daughters in the room next door. This is a totally unacceptable practice. If you plan on staying here and sleeping in, forget it. I was furious by the second phone call, but decided to just let it go since I was only staying one day. 
Other than that, the stay was OK, but if you pay full price you're wasting money. We stayed at the Embassy Suites the night before, right down the street, and it was MUCH nicer and about $--- a night less - plus it had free breakfast.",not happy
"I've stayed at many hotels during my visits to Chicago. This was my first visit to the Dana Hotel and this hotel became my favorite in the Chicago area.

"Only stayed - night. Arrived late, departed early. Had specific needs, and booked directly with Marriott.com due to price, location, and amenities.
Biggest need was airport shuttle. Was a bonus to get that, deluxe continental breakfast, and Marriott quality for under $----nt.
Property is well-maintained and buildings surround a courtyard area with room to relax. This outdoor area included patio tables-chairs and separate pool area. Great locale within easy walk to all Old Town has to offer.
Rooms included standard features, but a room with two beds seemed a bit cramped. Included photos were taken upon --pm arrival, in low light, with a phone, so apologies for quality.
Breakfast offerings were vast, and possibly the best I have seen for deluxe continental. Make your own waffles, hot breakfast sandwiches, cereals, yogurts, fruits, bagels, pastries, and a variety of beverages.
When arriving without checked baggage, I suggest calling for the shuttle as soon as you walk off the plane to avoid long wait at curbside. Hotel shuttle returns to airport on the hour, so plan accordingly when checking out.",happy
We were very pleased with the holiday inn midway. The hotel is new or newly remodeled. Clean. Modern. Friendly staff. No complaints.,happy
"I go back and forth whether to stay at the Regency or at the Grand Hyatt when I'm at DFW. I ususally choose the Grand Hyatt if the rates are similar, but the Regency will offer rate specials and discounts that the Grand typically doesn't. That was the case during my most recent stay, when I took advantage of a AAA rate that was half the rate of the Grand Hyatt. As always, the rooms were clean and comfortable. This property will try to accomodate their Diamond tier members with upgrades whenever possible. I've been upgraded to a VIP suite on a few occassions, including this stay. THANK YOU SO MUCH, Hyatt Regency DFW!! Your best customers REALLY appreciate the unsolicited upgrades! The VIP suites are super comfy with a well appointed living room-kitchen-and upgraded bathroom.
Breakfast was average and probably a little lower quality than I normally find at Jacob's, but it was fine. 
For those that shy away from staying at the airport hotels because of parking, both Hyatt properties validate parking tickets for overnight guests. (free)
Overall, another solid stay at the Hyatt Regency DFW and I look forward to my next visit.",happy
"I stayed in this hotel for a weekend in Sept ---- on vacation. If you're looking to stay in the heart of San Francisco, with easy access to mass transit and the major attractions, this is a good bet. We were able to secure a great deal on this hotel, where the special rate was an estimated -----% below similar hotels in the area. Ferry Building, with Trolley stop is a four block walk from the hotel. Take the trolley ($-.-- one way at time of writing this review) to Fisherman's wharf and Alcatraz Ferry, or walk ----- minutes. Cable routes are within several blocks. 
The drawbacks are the rooms are small. We should have had more pillows in the room. If you are renting a car from the airport, they do not have on-site parking, so you will have to park down the street. But try taking an airport shuttle instead and see if you can take in the sites on foot. 
If you can live with those drawbacks, the interior decor of the hotel and rooms is updated and fresh. The price was below market (for the S.F. financial district at the time we booked) representing a very good value.",happy

We asked for an upgrade to a big room (we had just come from a huge suite in Vegas, and though we'd treat ourselves here!). The guy was more than helpful and arranged everything within minutes.
We got a huge room with what was essentially a separate sitting room. It was an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""executive suite"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" of some sort, but well worth the extra --dollars a night on top of what we had already paid.
The bed in the room was big and comfortable, the room and bathroom were both clean and the hotel staff kept them tidy.
The best part about the hotel was the location. It was just perfect. within minutes of all the shops you could want. One of the main Cable Cars stops is just around the corner and brings you right over to Fishermans Warf, and Chinatown is only a - min walk away. 
The concierge was very helpful in recommending various places to eat.

We went to Iron Cactus & sat outside and had a great time. -th Floor Museum is just a few blocks away, and generally the hotel is in a great location.
Only negatives - AC was noisy and wish they'd put wedding parties on separate floors from regular guests. We had noisey neighbors from -am - -am that kept waking us up.",happy

I found no complaints with this hotel and would stay again.",happy
"Room was good (except for comforter which was worn and had an obvious large stain - I'm not picky since I never use a hotel comforter, but that was not cool). Honour bar and snacks. Had a good view over Beale Street. Highlight was the bathroom which was very big and had a separate shower stall as well as a bathtub. Furniture was modern and sleek. Gym was okay for a Westin but not the best I've seen. Had breakfast at Bleu in lobby and it was simple but good (no breakfast buffet option).
In regards to Beale Street, I was surprised how small it was. Having just done Broadway in Nashville the night before, I didn't realize the two were so different. Beale definitely gave off a more """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""gritty"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", more aggressive vibe which may or may not be what you're looking for.

I used to live in Manhattan and would not have chosen this location if it were not for the price as there is not a lot around the hotel in terms of restaurants, coffee shops and bars that are open during the weekend. The building is old and used to be an apartment building, so my room was an alcove studio, complete with a small kitchen. The room was spacious and the bathroom was at a glance was updated cosmetically, which was ok, except the water in the tub didn't drain properly and I found myself standing in -"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" of water by the end of my shower. The bathroom was not completely updated, as evidenced by the edges of the baseboards which were dusty and crumbling in some sections. The bathroom appeared to be clean until I saw several short hairs in various areas on the floor. I've stayed at less expensive hotels in NYC and they've been cleaner than what I saw at the Affinia. I really just laid my head down there for one night and didn't utilize the staff or other things in the hotel. The sheets and the bed were great. If I hadn't found a deal on this room, I wouldn't have stayed there and now that I have, I think I will look elsewhere if I need a room again and am willing to pay over $---.",not happy
"I booked a room in October ---- as part of a conference. After booking it someone told me that it had gotten some poor ratings. But I was happily suprised to receive a very nice room, quite clean, with everthing working as it is suppose to. The conference went quite well and from my view point there were no problems. I didn't hear anyone complaining. I had breakfast in their restaurant and it was quite good, service was good as well. We did have some problems with the sound system when our conference got together in the large hall. The evening banquet was good, food was above average for these sort of conferences. It was strange though no coffee was served. It wasn't just our table either, I was scouting around for a pot, but didn't see anything. check-out was a breeze and uneventful. I'd go back.",happy
"We stayed at this hotel when going sightseeing in Washington D.C. 
When going out because it walked from Union Station and it was immediate, the hotel was very convenient. It is possible to walk soon in Smithsonian, Newseum, and United States Capitol. 
The hotel can sleep very well. 
The equipment of the hotel is always clean, and always beautiful. 
All hotel employees were kind. 
It is a very wonderful hotel.
I'll stay this hotel when going to Washington next time.",happy
"I am very disappointed with this hotel. I heard that it was a first class hotel, and booked my reservations on Expedia over - weeks in advance. I specifically requested a room with a king-size bed, and was required by Expedia to prepay for the trip. I received my credit card bill before the trip! I gave them my contact information before the trip. I showed up at the hotel and requested my """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""reserved"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room, and was told that they were sold out of rooms with king size beds and would be given a room with two double beds instead. No upgrades available, even though they gave my room to someone else. I had no choice but to take that room. I was assured that I would get a king size bed the next day. The next day, no one called me about switching my room. When I called the front desk, I was told that they had no note from the manager about switching my room. However, after discussions, they said they found me another room with a king size bed. They brought me the keys to the other room. I vacated my existing room, left the keys to the existing room inside that room and went to the new room. Unlocked the door to the new room, only to find that it was still occupied!!!!! So, I had to call to get my original room back. What a disaster! No one offered me a discount, a free cocktail, or anything for my trouble (and their repeated screw ups). I'll never go back to that hotel. And, from now on, I will get a written confirmation that the room I order (and pre-pay for) will actually be the same room that I receive!!!!",not happy
"On arrival we were greeted by a great conceire that was more than willing to give us great information. Being from Ohio, New York was a little overwelming and he did help with those jidders. The hotel was disappointing. We frequent Hampton Inn Hotels often and this one was very small. The rooms were very small with inadaquete space for - adults and - children. You really felt on top of each other and cramped. The cleanliness was not like a usual Hampton Inn. This hotel needs to be updated. The location was ok. It was - block from Madison Square Garden and a good -- minute walk to Times Square(which is where the main restaurants and many things to do). I will not return to this hotel.",not happy
"My boyfriend booked a trip to NYC for my christmas present, I am -- weeks pregnant so we knew this will be the last time we get away before the baby comes.
We took a late flight and arrived at the hotel around --:----am, the gentlemen at the desk was welcoming and first impressions of the hotel are great...nice recpetion area amd very modern. The receptionist provided us with our room key. My boyfriend requested a quite room as we knew times square would be fairly noisy. We were placed on the -th floor in what is described as a spacious queen room. 
The lift is small and very slow, we arrived on a dark floor with marks on the walls where the wallpaper had been knocked from luggage. My initial thoughts were that the hotel looked tired from the minute the lift doors opened! 
We opened the door for our room and immediatley see the bed, the room was tiny and no way near spacious...the room had a mild smell of smoke not fresh as if it had been smoked in before...the skirting boards were chipped and marked...wallpaper marks...and the black valance sheet that surrounds the bed was ripped and covered in marks...the bathroom door and front door had fingerprint marks on...I knew straight away I could not sleep in the room so we requested another room...we placed in room --- on the second floor this room was better but still not what I would call - star....we struggled to sleep due to the outdoor noise of times square and the main road...emptying of rubbish...sirens...I would rather sleep in a room with noise than the first room we was in.
The following morning after only a few hours sleep we woke up, got ready and packed our bags. I spoke with a very rude receptionist who had no sympathy and did want to hear any feedback her response was 'all hotels in NYC are of this standard' I requested to speak with the manager...we spoke with the manager and she was very apologetic she understood and sympathised with our situation. She told us to enjoy our day whilst she investigated with housekeeping and advised us that our bags will be moved to thew new room when we return.
We returned feeling apprehensive about the next room..we were placed on the -th floor in room --- the room was what we were originally hoping for, although we were upgraded to a king room, nice large comfortbale bed, bigger room with more space and quiet .The hotel manager left a lovely apology note with fresh fruit and still water. This was very kind.However, there were still some problems they place a throw on the end of the bed, in all rooms they were stained and either need replacing or washed, the bedding consists of a sheet with a duvet and another sheet, every night I would do my best to not let the duvet near me just the new sheets as I assumed the duvets were not washed!
The lifts are very frustrating, slow and small, your better off taking the stairs unless you have luggage!
We will not be returning to the hotel, the third room was much better and comfortable and I am sure if we were put int there in the beginning our experience would have been very dfferent.",not happy
"My overall experience at this hotel was average to above average. What really brought my opionion down regarding this hotel was being given a smoking room when my reservation confirmation stated I would have a non-smoking room. Granted, some of the fault is mine because I could have called the front desk and requested another room. However, it was late at night, my family was tired (my - and - year old daughters were already asleep), and we just wanted to get to bed. In any event, it shouldn't take a phone call from me to change our room. We should have been issued a non-smoking room in the first place since it was stated on our reservation confirmation. We didn't plan on spending a good deal of time in the room anyway. Lastly, I used my Marriott rewards points to secure the --night stay (normal charge is apparently ~$----night) so maybe we were low on their priority list. The smell was very distinctive when you first walked into the room. Other than the smell, the stay was nice!!! The hot breakfast was wonderful. The hostess was very friendly. She gave our kids coloring books and crayons to keep them busy during our breakfast. She also gave me directions to the train station to go to Wrigley Field. Her advice to take the train instead of the bus saved us a little bit of time. They offered multiple newspapers (Herald, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, etc). The hotel has easy access to Lake Shore Drive and provides an excellent opporunity to run-jog along the lake. You're about - blocks from Michigan Ave which has some of the world's best shopping and restaurants. We ate at the Cheesecake Factory (- minute walk) and the Food for Life """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""foodcourt."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Easy access to public transportation. 
Overall, a nice stay. We went to a Cubs game where Sammy Sosa hit a game-winnning homerun in the bottom of the --th to beat Houston so I'm sure that helped my mood when we got back to our smelly room.",not happy
"I stayed at this hotel with - teens who were attending a lacrosse camp at Woody Hayes Athletic Center. It was so close to the hotel, if it hadn't been -- degrees outside, they could practically have walked. The parking lot kind of connects to a Kroger and several restaurants, like Applebys, which made it convenient for quick meals.
I needed a rollaway bed, and it was there when we checked in. It wasn't the folded kind, but rather in one piece, which made it surprisingly comfortable. The camp wasn't over until - the next day, and I had nowhere to go after check-out at --, so they let me have the latest check-out possible, at -:--, and there was no extra charge. Now that is service!
The breakfast was excellent, with many choices, and the employee who serviced it kept it clean, clean, clean. The whole hotel itself was clean.
All in all, the hotel made the weekend camp experience a really good one. I will stay there again.",happy
"The service was prompt and excellent. The room was not only spotlessly clean but also laid out in a way that makes sense, modern, spacious, and comfy, with a big screen TV. Actual ceramic cups, sealed, with the coffee maker. Downstairs is what they call the cafe, basically the other side of the check-in counter, where they offer food and drink -- hours a day. The menu consists of soups, salads, sandwiches, and it's all made to order, to eat right there or take up to the room. We had tomato soup and turkey sandwich, it was fresh and delicious. I also saw cooked breakfast items on the menu. I like the convenience of having this type of food option, much less hassle than having to go to a proper restaurant, especially when arriving late at night. I highly recommend this hotel.",happy
"Nice hotel, good location, nice rooms - no full length mirrors (pet peeve) - no comfortable lounge to have a drink in - the bar is very dark and becomes a club on weekends. But the main issue for me was it is very difficult signing up to use internet access if you do not have a credit card billed to a US Address. The hotel uses T Mobile for internet access and it took two days dealing with T Mobile to solve this problem (and two months after returning home to cancel the continuing debits). The hotel staff were no help - they continued to transfer me to the same TMobile number. Many business guests (me included) make their choice of hotel dependent on high-speed internet access being readily available in the room. Additionally, it was very expensive especially since most hotels I stay in at this level provide free access.",not happy
"I have been travelling across America with friends for the last month and I have stayed in many hotels, NYLO has been my favourite and, in fact, one of the best and most unique hotels I have ever stayed in. It seems to be a new hotel and it doesnt have many reviews so i was not sure what to expect when we arrived buts it's in a really cool location with free parking which was perfect. The check-in was smooth and easy, but the real 'wow' moment was when we walked into our room, I thought we had been upgraded to a suite as the room was huge! It's not your normal hotel room... It reminded me of a cool loft apartment, exposed brick walls and bare ceilings and floors (sounds horrible but trust me it's amazing) very modern decor, huge flat screen TV on the wall, a sofa, art on the walls, - huge double beds with clean white linens, fantastic view of Dallas, I could go on and on. Very nice concept for a hotel room. Huge shower and a separate toilet area. Lots of space to hang clothes and hide suitcases. Free wi-fi in the rooms, I could have easily stayed in the room for my whole stay! The hotel it's self is just as good as the rooms, modern and lots of art everywhere, the rooftop pool was fantastic and the bar was great for having a few cocktails. There didn't seem to be many guests staying here so we felt like we had a lot of space and it felt really exclusive. Across the street there is a great restaurant-bar called the Cedar Social, I would recommend making a reservation as it was so busy in there but I can see why as the food was amazing, and across the other street there was a really nice coffee shop which was also a bar in the evening. I actually wanted to live in this hotel!",happy
"I held a corporate event at the Liberty Station Marriott. From the get go I was given top notch service from getting the event planned. If you are interested in scheduling an event there I would reach out to Chelsea Carone, she was great. I would also recommend holding it on the Fireside Terrace which is an outdoor space by the pool.
The overall service at the Liberty Station is second to none; the location is great as well. Right next to the airport, - miles from the beach and walking distance to a real nice marina. Be sure to walk around and check it out. Out back there is a nice trail to jog.
Great work to Chelsea and the entire staff for (Marlene, Lisa, Miriam, Marlene, Terry & Caroline).",happy
"My new husband and I stayed at this hotel -th November for -nights. I booked this hotel (direct) based on the very reasonable room rate for NYC and excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. We arrived by yellow cab and were greeted by such lovely and welcoming staff. I had advised upon booking (almost a year before departing) that it would be our honey moon. They had very kindly upgraded us from a lower floor queen room to a superior on the highest floor possible (--). A view of the Empire State Building to the left and a view of the Hudson to the right. Perfect. Reception also sent up a couple of cupcakes to our room with a note they had written offering their congratulations. What is lovely about this hotel is that there are only - rooms per floor and only those rooms can access your floor in the lift by swiping the door key in the lift. So there isn't a constant flow of people coming and going to their rooms or being noisy etc etc. Our room was nicely decorated and we had enough room. The bathroom was very modern and we had a lovely shower. The hotel isn't down the nicest of New York roads, but lets face it, you walk from your hotel to explore the city and back down the road, to the hotel for a nights sleep. It's not enough to worry about. Just a couple of seedy shops. Reception had free coffee in the mornings and warm apple in the afternoon. This was an added extra because you could just grab a takeaway coffee-apple and head to your destination. The hotel was apporx --- mins from Times Square. Not far at all. I really loved the feeling of this boutique style hotel and loved the fact that it is a bit of an undiscovered gem. I will always recommend this hotel for NYC.",happy

But we did enjoy our stay and would recommned this hotel for its great location and spacious rooms.",happy
"I have stayed in this hotel five times now. Fantastic location, but very poor hotel. It's a massive hotel with extremely dated decor and huge check in queues. Reception was done up by last time we went, but they need to spend money refurbishing the rooms. 
Last three trips we upgraded to the 'Penn ----' but every time we go we have to switch rooms as the first one they give us is like a scratty shoebox. Upgrade and you get a private dedicated check in area, fridge in the room, robes (I think)and private access to a room on the -- floor with contenental breakfast, papers, two PCs and coffee. Quite rude staff (But that's what you get in New York!). A lot of seating in reception which is handy. Very expensive gift shop, but very close to Macy*s which is - blocks away and Times Square which is about -- mins walk away. 
Powerful shower but bathrooms look dirty and sockets are more often than not hanging off the walls. All we use the room for is to get ready, sleep and give our feet a rest! Despite everything I will most probably stay again. Only reason - Location, location, location.",not happy
"My wife and I booked a cruise with my side of the family and decided to spend one night in San Pedro before we embarked on the ship. We booked our own room and the other three members of my family got the room next door which was adjoined. So far so good. We were told to talk to the bell desk to arrange for transport in the morning to the cruise ship, but no one was there. After waiting by the bell desk for -- minutes, we decided to just go upstairs and come back later. 
As we walked through the hotel to get to our room, we noticed the hallway doors were propped open by rag towels stuffed under the doors. EVERY single hallway door was propped up as such. Upon arrival at our room on the third floor (we stayed in room --- and my family in ---, we saw that the rooms had probably not been renovated since the ----s or early --s. The bathroom floor tile had a sticky film or oil that you could feel with even your shoes and the air conditioner was creaking and rusted. One of our bath towels had a yellow- brown stain on it that was visible while hanging. The air conditioner was actually only blowing regular air and wasn't working properly at all. We opened the window since it was cool outside, but the window opened only --- inches. We decided to go back downstairs and not worry about it since we were tired and checked in late as it was. 
We ate dinner at the restaurant with so-so food that was way overpriced, and for a party of -, an --% gratuity was added. I don't know if this is customary, but we didn't think a $--- dinner bill for - people with no alcoholic drinks ordered was a great deal.
We went back to the bell desk, and again, no one was present to make arrangements for us. We waited another -- minutes, and finally a bell person came. We went back upstairs and my wife fell quickly asleep. The window was still open, and starting at about --:--pm, a loud crashing was heard outside. I went to look and saw that our room view was of the alley- garbage disposal area of the hotel. It also seemed to be a sort of loading- dock area. Every ----- minutes, another crashing noise came which made it impossible to sleep. I had no choice but to close the window and turn on the broken air conditioner. The air conditioner blew air, but the air felt humid and extremely uncomfortable. I could have complained and gotten another room but my wife and family were asleep and exhausted so I chose to endure the horrible experience for the night. In total, I think I finally fell asleep around -am and slept for -.- or - hours. 
Disgruntled in the morning, I still washedup up in the nasty bathroom and used hand towels to dry myself off since my wife used the only non-stained bath towel we had. We went down to breakfast and had a decent breakfast buffet (free since we are Hitlon Gold Members). After packing up and coming downstairs for our --:-- transport, I thought the worst was over. I made my complaints about the above to the front desk to just """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""let her know"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and the lady just seemed to take some notes and said thanks for letting us know. At that point, I didn't really care anymore since I just wanted to be off on a good cruise and have no more worries about the crappy hotel experience.
We get into the transport vehicle, and my wife and I get into the back seat, and what did the driver have playing on the stereo? Unedited rap music with explicit sexual lyrics including all types of profanity that could send you down to he final level of hell. Once all passengers were loaded into the vehicle, the driver did NOT turn off the music or change the station! 
This is the absolute WORST hotel experience I have ever had. I will NEVER stay at it again even if it were free, and I will make sure none of my friends or family ever have to go through what I went through again.",not happy

Hotels are not cheap in NYC, and I suppose neither is the Pod considering the size of the rooms. But it's the best you'll find! Rooms are very modern, and they do well with the limited space (eg: beds are designed so you can put your suitcase underneath, every nook and cranny is fitted out for hanging clothes, etc). Location is perfect for the subway or for walking if you prefer, and there was free tea, coffee and juice in reception every morning.

"I definitely would not recommend this place or stay here again. It is very drab and low-end. On the plus side, it's easy to find and close to the highway. There's tons of parking and the front desk was nice and let me check in early. However...
The place is really old, in desperate need of an update in every way. The bathroom was dingy and my toilet ran constantly after it was flushed. Also, the bathtub was really scuzzy. There was no hairdryer, just a holder for one. When I called the front desk and asked for a replacement they told me they did not have any spare dryers. They also didn't provide conditioner for your hair. I found several tears in my comforter. Overall, the whole place just needs improved lighting. It's dim, including the lobby, and it makes the whole place seem depressed. Honestly I didn't feel completely safe there. I'm sure I was, but the dim and drab atmosphere really gave me the creeps. I spent the two nights I was there really wishing my husband had been with me. 
Overall, this is not a good place to stay. It's cheap, but you really get what you pay for. It's not a bargain. Next time I will definitely splurge and stay somewhere else.",not happy
"I booked this hotel because the location was going to be very convenient to the event I was attending. I really should have checked Trip Advisor first. This place is bad. Stay away!
I am normally a pretty easy-going traveler. Read my other reviews. However, this hotel disappointed in almost every way. The front desk staff was rude and unhelpful. The room was in very poor condition. The door lock looked like a last minute improvisation. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable that I have ever experienced. The grounds of the hotel were in disrepair. 
The highlights of my stay were that I was only there for one night, and my car was still in the parking lot in the morning.",not happy

Upscale hotels on the stuffy with the Louis XIV type decor aren't my cup of tea. There are doors between the bedroom and living room area well as for the bathroom. The standard rooms looked nice as well. Great R & G toiletries. The hotel staff were so friendly and accommodating. It was our first time in Philadelphia and we really loved the city! The hotel is a short walk to the Rittenhouse Square. Lombardi's for the best pizza is right around the corner. The hotel restaurant looked very nice but we liked going out to explore - Philadelphia has great restaurants! Buddakan was out of this world! My daugher loved Jones.

A little too """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""soon to be passed fad"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" modernist for my tastes, but well executed. I was on the sixth floor with a great view of the Chinese Theatre and the Hills. The bathroom was great, the second best hotel bathroom I have ever experienced. It had a huge walk in shower and a seperate tub-shower combo. More than I needed but it would be nice for a couple or family. The staff is big in attractiveness and short on skills. They were helpless when it came to questions about the (poor) internet service. No WiFi in my room, which I find unacceptabe at this price point and class of property. Also, the TV was particularly bad. It was a little noisy with party-ers on my floor, but I can't fault the hotel for that. This place attracts a wild crowd and I think that is some of the appeal.

"I love hotels, especially boutique hotels, and I think I'm a bit fussy about things being really nice, but I must be less fussy that some of my dear traving colleagues here on Tripadvisor. I too read the mixed reviews, and set me excpectations accordingly, thinking we were talking a bit of a chance but had an amazing rate from Priceline.
Our expectations were exceeded at every turn. Yes, the location is fantastic. But the hotel did not disappoint in any way! You walk into the ground floor next to a darling restaurant which is part of the hotel and take a cool elevator to the second floor to check in. The reception staff was warm, funny and welcoming. We were upgraded to a suite, which was just great -- made us wish it was longer than a one night stay! 
Our room was clean, the carpet looked great. Though not high end, the furniture was tasteful, clean, comfortable, modern. Our king bed had a fabulous red coverlet and upholstered to the ceiling headboard to match. Mmmm. We had a minibar fridge that had room for our stuff. Bed and pillows were great. And they do this window treatment that is difficult to describe but so lovely.
OK, let's discuss the bar. We were out late, came in for a nightcap. The music was loud, the lighting was dim, the cocktails were a perfect nightcap. The feel was very sexy, and we had a great time.
Asked for a late checkout, no problem at all,and they stored our luggage until our matinee got out. Miguel even helped me walk our stuff across the street in the freezing cold! Yes, by the way, there's a parking garage right across the street with a nice discount.
Any downsides? I love when hotels have complimentary lobby coffee, and The Time does not, though the restaurant was happy to accomodate, and there's a Starbucks half a block away. 
All in all, a delightful stay. The Time is on our list for future stays!",happy
"When we checked in, the smell was not pleasant. The front desk staff was very nice initially, although my reservation for a refrigerator for my medication was not on file, nor apparently was the conversation that I had with an individual - months prior to my arrival that would allow us to have the refrigerator at no charge for medical reasons. They gave us the fridge, which I appreciated very much. When we asked about the fitness center, we were told that there are really only - machines that do not always work by the front desk worker. After being injured on the elevator grate - very heavy and difficult to maneuver into and out of with luggage - we arrived in our room. There was mold on the shower head, the toilet handle fell off in my hand, there was hair in the tub, and it was extremely cramped. When we spoke with the desk staff, they showed us another filthy room. After contacting the company that we made our reservations with, they agreed to cancel our reservation, but still charge us for a night (we left before check-in time actually occurred) in the amount of $---. To make matters worse, they said they would only refund a portion of the amount due back - the hotel costs (not including taxes and fees) charged to my credit card was $---.--, they said they would only refund $---.--. As of right now, I am still waiting for any refund at all (-.- weeks later). Not worth the time, money, or hastle. That all being said, Rebecca was very friendly at the front desk, she was perhaps the only good portion of this hotel.",not happy
"Hip, happening hotel that was very nice. If you have ever stayed at Dream hotel in NYC - it's like a Target version of that. Concrete, modern, etc. The staff were very nice and accomodating. The rooms are laid out differently - the bed is in the middle of the room and tv is on the exterior wall. I thought that was a pretty cool idea because in some hotels, you can hear the other rooms tv or the bed against the wall... 
The only downside I would say is that some of the finishes appeared cheap. The thread count on the sheets are very low. For me personally, the lowest I'd ever go is ---. These seemed like ---. Also, the finish on the walls is like a fabric and for me, that's not cool - I am allergic to dust mites and fabric is a great hiding place for dust mites. 
I don't know if it's because this is a new hotel and they are still working out kinks but the fridge in my room blew hot air, not cold so I wasn't able to use the fridge the one night I wanted to. 
I also had an issue with the wireless. I had to call the help desk twice in four nights. 
Not bad for the money but for about $-- more a night, I'd rather stay at Hotel Indigo down the road.",not happy
"The hotel was in a great location if you need to be near Hobby Airport. The staff was absolutely fantastic. The breakfast buffet was really great, lots of variety and the waffles were shaped like the state of Texas. The rooms were really great and liked the new colors. The only problem were the air conditioning units. This property must have had a life as another hotel because the air units were old and did not work well. They cycled on and off too often and the time cycle was like - minutes. Every time the a-c started up in the middle of the night, it would wake you up. Asked the front desk for help, but I am not sure that anything could be done. Didn't sleep as well as I wanted. Next time, sleep on the sofabed maybe.",not happy
"This location is great! Walking distance to the Capitol building or the Mall with the Smithsonians... The hotel... We totally loved this place! We had a beautiful and very large room with a full kitchen. Basically it was like staying in a nice apartment. The beds were very comfy and the room was always kept nice and clean. The staff was very friendly and the breakfast was the best free hotel breakfast we've ever had. The only slight negative was the pool is ridiculously small. But who cares, it's DC... Go see the amazing sights until you're ready to drop!
If we ever make it back to DC we will definitely stay here again!",happy

"Booked a couple of nights at The Nolitan recently because my usual favorites were sold out. I had very low expectations but love the neighborhood. I have to say, I was impressed from the first minute I walked in the door. The staff was old school accommodating and helpful, but also fun and charming. By the time I checked out I was on first name basis with the whole staff!
Rooms were small but well designed. Bed was comfortable with good linens. Continental breakfast could be expanded a bit, but it was well presented and the coffee was good.
I would stay here again, for sure.",happy
"I had never heard of Club Quarters before, but based off of the reviews on TA, am SO glad we took the risk and stayed there.
First of all, it was under a $--- a night, which is unheard of in Chicago, unless you're seeking out hostiles. The location was ideal, within walking distance from the majority of the downtown attractions, including the Willis Tower SkyDeck, Millennium Park, the Art Institute and Buckingham Fountain. (Which is good, because we found the the subway line wasn't very helpful for tourist destinations.) The room itself, while quite small, was tastefully decorated, immaculately clean and very comfortable. I only noticed noise from other rooms on one night, the rest of the time you could hear a pin drop. We were on the --th floor, so city noise was minimal and the elevators were insanely fast and you never had to wait long to get one. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. I liked the fact that there was a lot of serve-yourself conveniences, though I could see others viewing that as a detraction. For instance, you check in-out using an electronic kiosk, if you want an extra blanket or ironing board, you find a guest closet in the hallway and help yourself. They offered a gym, a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""living room"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to hang out in, and free bottled water on every floor at the elevators. The pub connected next door had very tasty and reasonably priced food. And if you need to park a car, we did the self park for $---day (roughly $-- cheaper than just choosing a garage), which was a short - minute walk away, though they do offer valet if you so desire.
The only negative I can come up with is the thermostat...it was impossible to figure out how to get the heat on, and the room was too chilly the whole time. We should have asked at the front desk as I'm sure they could have helped us, we just never made the time or forgot. 
Overall, I highly recommend Club Quarters the next time you're in Chicago.",happy
"My daughters and I stayed at the Hotel Monticello because of its proximity to the French Embassy. It exceeded our expectations. The hotel is --- block from the canal, and --- block from """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""M"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" street, the main shopping and dining street in Georgetown. We strolled along the canal, and found a wonderful restaurant for dinner. Access to the main part of DC is easy, using the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Circulator Bus"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". It costs only $-. The hotel staff were warm, welcoming and professional. They are the best! Our room was lovely, with a huge floor-to-ceiling marble bath, large dressing area and mirrored wet bar which served as a kitchenette. The bed was the most comfortabe I have ever slept on! Breakfast was nice with pastries, cereal, and bagels with Starbuck's coffee. As with any situation, there were a couple of negatives. It took quite a while for hot water to reach our room. There is one small elevator, which can get heavy use, so sometimes there was a wait. The many positives far outweighed the minor negatives, so I would definitely stay at Hotel Monticello again. The only regret is that it was only one night!",happy
"We stayed at Hotel Andra in early July for two nights. I had spent hours scouring the pages of TripAdvisor for somewhere to stay whilst in Seattle. From the moment we arrived everything was perfect. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. They pointed out all the best places to watch the -th July fireworks from, and provided us with a map of how to get around. Our room was small but more than adequate. The furnishings were luxurious, and everything immaculate. We both slept well, and never even heard another sole all night. Unfortunately we didnt get the chance to sample the delights of the restaurant, but from the outside it looked like the perfect place for a romantic meal. What we did find very useful was the business centre which was free of charge and open --hrs. All in all we couldn't fault the place. The location is perfect. We walked easily to the Space Needle & Lake Union. Pike Place Market was no more than a -- minute walk, and the shops were just a stopnes throw away. This hotel is a must!",happy
"I just had a short one stay in Houston and choose this Hotel because contingent of convention people I knew where stayin here. In hindsight, i should have styed a few miles away and saved quite a bit of money. On the upside, the hotel was nice, quite, and staff was very friendly. The convention center was a bit to far away to walk comfortably but it appeared there was plenty of shuttles or taxis available.",not happy
"Firstly, if you're looking for a hotel right next to the airport - this is about - interstate exits away.. fairly close, but I wouldn't want to pay for a taxi to an airport from here!!
This La Quinta was undergoing some renovations when we visited. I was worried about noise, but they weren't noisy. However, I strongly suspect this used to be a different kind of hotel - it just didn't have that La Quinta feel at ALL. It's easily the worst La Quinta I've ever stayed in.
Our air conditioner struggled to cool the room (and it wasn't even full-on Florida heat outside) and we woke up to the feeling of dew everywhere in the morning. A major purpose of AC in Florida is to pull the moisture out of the air. The front grill of the AC kept falling open, too.
There was a mysterious small hole in the light switch in the toilet-bath room, which lined up with the front of the shower. There have been enough incidents in hotels and other businesses of hidden cameras that I found this worrisome - no problem, I took the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Give us a --!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" sticker off the toilet paper and covered it up (btw, they are trying VERY HARD to get your '--'...) The smoke detector in the room was in an odd location, as well. Paranoid? Probably.
While I'm still thinking about the bathroom - this is one of those bathrooms that require you to do a dance to get the door closed - and in fact, the door brushes up against the toilet on open-shut. I doubt this is accessible. Showerhead was too short for me, and I'm only -'-"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Faucet aerator was broken.
Breakfast was a major disappointment. In my past travels, I've always associated LQ with a good breakfast. They had 'decided not to' put the waffles, fruit, etc. out - there was some Otis Spunkmeyer muffins and some plain bagels, coffee, some juice (most out) and two kinds of cereal. They started putting things away before - am. Nowhere were the breakfast times posted. The room completely lacked one of those guidebooks with the hotel map, policies, etc.",not happy
"It was my first visit to USA and also my first time at a St. Regis. The hotel is in an excellent location, just two blocks or so from the famous White House. and in the proximity of most of the attrations the city has to offer. We were upgraded to a suite which was a large room complete witha well-equipped bathroom. The room could have been better configured to be divided in two offering a bit more privacy. I particularly liked the soft material of the bathrobe. Not the usual thick toweling but soft silky material. The large mirror on the wall in the bathroom also included a TV very convenient whilst soaking in the tub. The hotel has one restaurant. The Adour by Alain Ducas. Whilst this is an excellent one, it would have been nice to have a less sophisticated place for lunch and dinner on premises. However, the hotel is surrounded by very good restaurants to suit all tastes and pockets. One of the family favourites is Mcormick and Schmick's a few meters away from the St. Regis. The reception staff at the hotel were not always that keen on smiling, although the doormen always offered their help be it with opening the heavy doors or calling a cab. This being the St. Regis, there is no buffet breakfast included in the room rate. Breakfast is a la carte and may add up to quite a bit at the end of the stay. Quality is excellent, and so is the service offered by waiting staff. Back in Washington DC I would go back to this hotel.",happy
"The owners of this location have done an excellent job of maintaining this hotel, and the price in very reasonable. The room was clean, the breakfast area was kept clean, and there was a good variety of offerings for the breakfast, ...I would certainly recommend this hotel.......",happy
"I would definitely stay at Chicago's House of Blues Hotel again, despite a few 'caveat emptor' notes. First, they gave away our room the first of three nights. However, they put us up in the nearby, fancy Ritz-Carlton (a far superior but boring luxury hotel), even giving us cab fare to and from the Ritz. Why did this happen? 'A group came in,' the unsmiling young clerk said, as though bracing for a tirade. 
Thinking maybe it was a group of groupies for some band playing at the HOB next door, we didn't protest much. I suspected it also had to do with the fact that we booked through Expedia, but can't substantiate that. Expedia was great. After paying in advance and having Expedia alert the hotel in writing that we were arriving late and us calling the hotel directly that afternoon from the east coast to confirm ('yes, we have your reservation'), it sucked coming from the airport and being summarily told there was no room. But points to the HOB for putting us up at the Ritz-Carlton (which failed to give us the requested roll-away cot when they didn't have a room with two beds for two straight guys so one of us slept on the floor on a bedspread at the Ritz after coming in at - a.m. but that's another story). Anyway, next morning, we called the HOB to tell them we were coming over for our room. 'Yes, sir, we have three rooms with twin beds.' Only problem was, -- minutes later, the front desk tried to tell us there were no such rooms. Persistence paid off, and we soon found ourselves in a nice, spacious room on the --th floor. Everything else about the HOB hotel was good. In fact, they wanted to comp us with a Junior Suite after the trouble we were put through, but it didn't have two beds. Points for HOB Hotel. We liked the room decorations and colors, although the voodoo motif might have scared the heck out of kids or a sleepwalker. The room had a great view and floor-to-ceiling windows that actually opened! Excellent air-conditioning. The bathroom was outstanding, as was the maid service. Night-owls will like the opague curtains. The towels were thin, but the shower fine. Doors were solid and elevators efficient. 
The place seemed new and was very clean. No hookers seemed to be hanging around, although there was plentiful scenery in this chic location. The TV reception was poor and number of cable channels small. 
But we didn't go to watch TV so didn't matter. They give you a compiliation blues CD. Rooms have a good little stereo system, so bring your own CDs. The room was spacious, with a desk chair, but no lounge chairs. Nice hassock, though. The downstairs bar, which just won a Chicago magazine poll for best hotel bar, was dead as a doornail Sunday-Monday-Tuesday. But the adjacent House of Blues restaurant-concert hall was hopping. The HOB location is great, just over the Chicago River from the Loop subway stops, meaning you can take a subway from either O'Hare or Midway and walk to the hotel if you're traveling pretty lightly. The river itself is dwarfed by majestic architecture and topped by multiple picturesque bridges, a few blocks away from the site of the ---- Eastland ship disaster that killed --- people (plaque marks the site for history buffs). Besides a friendly Smith & Wollensky next door overlooking the river, the general area is kind of beautiful but kind of dead, so hop on the Red Line to Wrigleyville or just about anywhere in the city (we got a three-day $-- subway-bus pass that we wore out). Back to the hotel--the lobby looks like something out of Marrakesh; this is not your average expensive hotel, perhaps an acquired taste, but I would definitely stay there again. Staff was pretty friendly, location is bedrock Chicago, subway right nearby, and you might get a break on the price through Expedia or other on-line broker; our average cost for Saturday-Sunday-Monday was about $---. And we brought the dress code a bit down to earth at the Ritz in the process!",happy

"Had to go to a conference which was held @the Marriott--but truth be told, I prefer to stay away from the conference crowd--so due to a cool AARP deal (thanks to the husband being over --), we stayed @the Hampton Inn.
Although there were renovations going on, the staff was apologetic and accommodating! Truly a great front desk staff--especially Danielle--for granting us a late-checkout, getting us a cab in - minutes, and providing interesting tidbits about what to do around town!
The Positives: Price, convenience to everything, tasty breakfast, free Internet, fabulous staff.
A Few Mild Negatives: Since I had to work in my hotel room for a few hours (last minute touch ups on the presentation), the renovations during the day were a bit loud--but we knew about the renovations in advance.",happy
"We received a two nights free stay at the Embassy Hotel as a free gift 
for attending a time share presentation. Having read the reviews from 
Trip Advisor.com, and knowing that this was not the Embassy Suites, we 
were prepared for the worst, which is exactly what we got! The 
neighborhood surrounding the hotel is one of the worst in San 
Francisco, which includes pan handlers, transients, prostitutes and 
drug dealing. 
 Upon arrival we were greeted at the counter and given an actual key (as opposed to the what seems to be the standard, in today's technology, a key card) We then boarded an ancient elevator, which had a door that needed to be opened from the outside with a door handle. The elevator held only four people at a time and would not operate unless the entry door was closed. (At one point we waited approx -- minutes for the elevator on the fourth floor, due to the fact that the entry door hadn't been closed on the ground floor.) 
 Our walk to our room was met with trash left in the hallway (which was still there the next day) by other guests. Most of the other guests seemed to be students of the Culinary Academy located across the street from the hotel. 
 Upon entry into our room, we discovered several black mold spots on the bathroom walls, poor patch jobs to the bathroom tile, a picture which was hung upside down and very few amenities. 
 After spending the night listening to the neighborhood locals scream and yell, hearing the numerous sirens go past the hotel, waking to the sound of the guest in the room next door throwing up, accompanied with the odor of vomit, we decided to check out, even though we still had another free night stay left. 
 The only bright spots were that it was an architecturally interesting building, which was built in the ----'s, although it needed serious remodeling and the Temple bar and grill had pretty good food.",not happy
"This motel feels a bit tired and although our room was clean, it felt old & tired. Carpet around the edge of the room was loose and the door to the bathroom had a very loud squeal that just about would have woken everyone in the complex. We did ask that they oil it & the next day it was better, but surprised it hadn't been picked up prior to us mentioning it. Staff were helpful in suggesting buses into town & we were thankful for free parking also. Good venue, with buses nearby for getting to Fisherman wharf, Union Sq etc.",not happy
"Having spent - nights in a small hotel uptown in Manhattan, the - night """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""luxury treat"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" at the Waldorf should have been the highlight of our x-mas trip. But it was more of a let-down. There is nothing romantic, friendly, warm, or exciting about it, but the name. So the location is great. no doubt about it. The staff (except for one lady whose role was hard to define - but she seemed like an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""angel in the lobby - mrs fix-it-all"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" - she was brilliant) was very! ordinary. That started with a very rigid and partially even rude process of getting our reservation done. the check-in was more like standing in line at the post office - is this really - stars?? the level of friendliness is minimal and the doorman rudely ask for tip. Now, we travel between ---- times on leisure per year, and tipping in different countries is no stranger to us. Yet, asking for is so bluntly, whilst he didn't even hail down the cab for us (we had to do that ourselves) is just not what you'd expect of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The Waldorf"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" - in the end, I have to say, it's just another very ordinary Hilton hotel - not worth the money they take of you. The A-C in the room is hard to manage and totally outdated, the rooms are big & spacious - that was nice. Breakfast in the Lobby Restaurant was very ordinary and service was slow. The hostess seems to float on a cloud of Ego....not sure she understands service quality and that the guest actually pays her salary. The -nd breakfast option was literally laughable....it's a cheap-charly buffet version that you'd expect in a --star hotel; Compared to other --star hotel breakfasts, this was a disappointment and we opted to not eat in the hotel at all for the rest of our stay. The bar is fairly nice & barmen seem to know what they are doing. The best part however was the super-cheap approach by """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Ms sales woman"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as my husband was waiting for me. Her smile didn't stop as she tried to sell!!! right after our arrival, some Hilton Card. - You'd expect that on a bazar in Morroco, but certainly not in the lobby of a --star hotel. Very cheap approach. The washrooms in the public areas are guarded by staff which is super unfriendly and rude. Obviously the hotel is used --% as a tourist attraction and there is no security or anyone that would allow the guest a bit of privacy.

Instead the room charge was to be --.-- a night.
The customer prior to me was being treated very rudely when I arrived and she eventually refused to stay.

That is until I noticed the blinds did not work. I called down and they set someone up, they said they couldn't fix them because they did not have the part (aka I am out of luck, so sorry) Then I notice my bulb was out in the bathroom, and my floor lamp wouldn't work(the main light) They replaced the bulb. Told me they could not replace the lamp till the next day((aka I am out of luck, so sorry) Then when they came a -rd light went out while they were there, again they replaced it. So basically they do not check their rooms at all before giving out keys. Then I had a Traders Joe's bag full of paper goods , food and above all religious items. It was under the desk.

"After staying there I now agree with other reviewers that this is a good hotel if you are only going to be in town for a few days I was there for a week and that was too long. I purchased a club level room, which is on the --st or --nd floor of the tower buliding and you get a lot of perks with that as well. 
When I arrived I had to wait over - hours for my room becuase the person that was staying in my assigned room had not bothered to check out yet. They offered me a room on a lower level but I would still get the club benefits but I decided to wait for the room I paid for not some lower level replacement. The staff also told me that a different club level room was available and that it would be -- minutes so that the staff could clean it so I took this option. An hour later I approached the desk for the third time and was given room keys and sent on my way. 
The club room on the --nd floor is nice but is not all that exciting to be honest, it has great views and has complimentary snacks and drinks as well as breakfast and dinner snacks but not enough nor quality enough to warrant what I paid to stay there.
About the thrid day into my vacation I decided to go and see what the breakfast in the club room had and arrived in time to see dirty plates everywhere and to find out that I was too late. After inquiring more information from the staff member that was up there I learned that upon check in I should have been given a welcome letter explaing all of this and vouchers for the restaraunt in the lobby as well. I went down to the front desk and explained my grief about not being informed. I was then given the welcome letter and some vouchers I was technically owed so all in all they did not really give me anything extra. Also I leanred from the club room staff memeber that the room would be closed for the next week which I was NOT AT ALL INFORMED ABOUT! This was truly upsetting. 
So for my trip that I paid for I got:
average staff members
below acceptable customer service
the rooms were good only becuase of the view (the rooms also had extremely firm mattresses that I was unable to sleep on and NO FRIDGE) I had to go and buy a cooler so my leftovers would not go to waste!!!
Overall I spent too much money on services and options that I did not get to use and did not get any kind of compensation for my extra expenses.

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, we arrived too early but they stored our bags for us until we returned later to check in, enabling us to have a walk around the city.
The room itself was comfortable and clean, there were limited choices for breakfast but the food was good quality although there was a lack of seating when busy.
The location is not ideal, it was further from Union Square than I had expected given the description but it is on a direct bus route, and the cable car terminus is just - blocks up.
The excellent Mel's Diner is attached to the hotel, and Tommy's Joynt opposite is a fantastic place to eat and drink.",happy
"Stayed here: - july ---- - - july ----
When entering the hotel there only were two elevator doors, and a A- not pointing out to use the stairs to get to the reception at the -nd floor. Through some nasty hallways, stairways and doors we arrived at the reception. This looked fine. The only employee also had to take the phone which took a lot of her time and made us wait for a very long time to let us know our room wasn't ready yet. 
Returning a few hours later (first watched Live-) we could check in (again we had to wait very long, the receptionist got stressed more and more and got rude to people on the phone). The room had no view, was very small and had tiny beds. It also was very dusty.
The bathroom was clean, but again very clean, you could hardly sit on the toilet...
Checkout took very long again, it will also take a very long time before I will stay here again...
Well, I think it's clear, very small rooms, bad staff, high price. Just go somewhere else.",not happy
"I have stayed a couple of times now in the Loews Regency when I come to NY for business. Unlike other hotels in this price category that Loews offers spacy rooms.
Sleeping experience is first class - very comfortable beds and no noise whatsoever. 
I usually start my day with a run in Central Park and as the Loews is - blocks away from the park, it is in an ideal location. 
Check out and check in is very efficient.",happy
"I booked this hotel because of the reviews on TripAdvisor.com. They were right! Great hotel and a great stay. The staff was extremely helpful and generous with their time when asked about the local area attractions. The rooms were small, but we were only in the hotel to sleep. It was such a close walking distance to everything. This is the only play I'll stay when visiting Boston. :)",happy
"I was a little leery booking this hotel because of the reviews but because we got such a fantastic rate and we wouldn't be spending very much time in the room we took it. I'm glad that we did! The hotel itself is a little dated but I can say that it is very clean and neat. There was always an available elevator and the staff was very friendly and helpful and we were always greeted with a smile!
I would definitely stay here again because of the staff and because of the location. We were in the middle of everything!",happy
"The hotel was clean and the rooms were nicely decorated. The hotel and furniture were in good shape. They also had a little 'shop' downstairs where you could purchase snacks and small frozen meals.
The room service was fast but after the gratuity charges and another surchrage the waitress still lingered about for a tip. I didn't like her.
My room was also not cleaned on my second day because I was in my room the two consecutive times the cleaning lady knocked. I told her to come back in an hour. She didn't. But they were very nice aout bringing the beauty products that weren't restocked as a result of the room not being cleaned up to me very quickly.
I found Phoenix quite small and it was about -- minutes to most points of interest. The hotel was fairly central. Less if I knew my way around a bit. If I were to go again I would get a place closer to Tempe where there was actual life on the streets. If you do decide to stay at this hotel make sure to go to the Chinese Cultural Centre enarby to eat and check out the amazing grocery store.
The only significant shortcoming of the hotel was it's pool. I expected something nice and large but instead it was a small pool surrrounded by iron gating in the front of the hotel so you were kind of on display to the people parking and checking in. It would be nice if the pool surrounding were a little more lush at least.",happy
"Me and my fiance' decided to get away just before our wedding. Club Quarters offered a reasonable rate at a well situated locale...The good...check in was fast and the, tall, blonde haired guy working behind the desk was accomodating and super efficient...Kudos to him. Unfortunately, everything else was lacking. Rooms were of substandard condition. Due to the age of the building, the walls did not have sound proofing. The doors also were without air compressors so that they would slam when closed. I tried to take a nap about -:-- and all I could hear were kids and adults slamming doors and running around. The room also had a thermostat which would seemed to be non-functional...Me and my fiance froze our butts off even after raising the temp to its highest level. I have seen better bathrooms in -rd world hotels and no tub. My fiance got a workout moving furniture just so that she could find an outlet for her ITouch.
We then decided to go get some pizza at Bucina's(sp?) which we saw in our hotel's restaurant advertisement book. Well, I asked for directions from the girl at the front desk who circled its approximate location. In reality, all she had to say was that it was at the Club Quarters north location which was clearly on the map. Thanks for having us walk in circles for -- minutes....
At the time of our checkout, we decided to get some breakfast at the English pub next door. Don't even bother. We were hoping to get in and out fast so that we could get to the Field Museum...No such luck.. Waited for -- minutes...no service I finally had to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""tackle"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" one of the waitresses to find out what was going on. The end result was $-.-- for orange juice I never ordered, one slice of toast with the food, the orders were wrong, and stiffed when I paid the bill because the manager said there was no change? I actually went into the hotel to tell the front desk what happened and the girl who was looking gave me a beautiful smile and a blank stare. Unfortunately, there were few restaurants open on Sunday near the hotel otherwise I would have ran for the hills. In the case of the hotel, I ran for the exit.",not happy
"Ok first impression as you get off the exit is...um...not sure if we wanna stay here. The neighborhood not the best, all the hotels in the area are behind steal fencing. However, once you get in the hotel, it has a great and warm feeling to it. The front desk staff was outstanding, made us feel so welcome. The room itself was as typical and standard as a Hampton, will all the expected amenities. The rate was about what we expected, so can't complain there. The breakfast in my opinion was a step above the typical breakfast. We had omelets and waffles and turkey sausage, fruits, muffins, bagels etc. The breakfast hostess was very helpful answering questions about the area. The housekeepers came out and greeted all of us before they started work. You could tell they were having fun and enjoying their job. We left with a smile on our face, and if we are back in Memphis, we'll stay here again. Location was close to the airport for us, not to far from downtown, shopping, foods etc...and didn't have to pay the price to stay over on Poplar.
Great job! Keep it up!!",happy
"Above average digs and perfect location for the convention center. Big plus was the ION water filter system at the health club for drinking water, and the adequate pool in the basement where I watched the Celtics and Pistons after a swim while peddling a stationery bike in a much-too-tight Speedo (as Sam Kinison used to say, thanks for the visual)! Bedding and LCD TV added to the comfortable surroundings. Who cares if one gets a beautiful view of the adjoining parking structure? Any woman, that's who! For guys, forget about it! Lobby was spacious as well as the bar restaurant combo. One could not ask for a better abode for only $-- plus taxes at a three star hotel in the Inner Harbor.",happy
"I love this hotel. The rooftop pool, the fabulous gym, the amazing Burger Joint. It's in a great location that is just a block from Times Square, but enough out of the way that you don't have to deal with the crowds. The downside is the rooms are in need of renovation. The TV was the very old, tube type and it took a while to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""warm up."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I think that highlighted the amount of time since a renovation since most hotels have now moved to a flat screen. Overall, I love the hotel and will stay again.",happy
"Stay was okay at best. Rooms are super small and can get claustrophobic when trying to escape the rain. Wireless internet was terrible in the rooms, barely could stay connected. Room thermostat didn't work right, would either keep blowing hit air non-stop or would shut off completely so we would be either sweating or freezing. Probably will stay somewhere else next time we visit Seattle...in fact we are. Next time in February we will be at the Hyatt. 
Got a deal on Expedia,$--- including parking. I would refuse to pay anymore than that.",not happy
"Very affordable for location and amenities. Within walking distance to Navy Pier. After late night in Chicago, got room service, which was delicious and easy. Use underground parkade across from NBC Tower, is about half the price of the parkade beneathe the Sharaton. Room was clean and comfortable. Would definately stay here again because of the price.",happy
"I was in Seattle on business this past week, and based on room price I decided to stay at the Doubletree at Seatac instead of where I usually stay, the Hampton Inn directly across the street. (The rate difference was a whopping $-.--). So to save $--night, I ended up paying $---night for parking (valet parking is $---night), and $--.----- hours for internet. I received one $-- coupon for any meal, but even as a Hilton Diamond member, there was no coupon for breakfast each morning. The Doubletree is okay, the restaurant and bar are nice. But unless you have a room in the Tower building with a mountain view, (and you need to be on the -th floor at least), there is absolutely nothing special about this hotel.
I will be back in Seattle next month and will galdly return to the newly remodeled Hampton Inn. The bed is wonderful, the working space is adequate, and the breakfast is complimentary for all. As for internet and parking, no extra charge.",not happy
"I just came back from a - weekend stay and I must say I haven't seen service this good in a while. The persons on site are darlings all of them. Breakfast is abundant for a fast starter and took me by surprise. Forget the continental style this has all the works. Shuttle from - to -- and -- to --, on the hour. Gym needs work, some equipment needs repair, pool and Spa are fine. I'd recommend this hotel to my friends.",happy
Very pleasant. I've never stayed in Tribeca before and loved the area. Wonderful restaurants. Room very pleasant as well. Hotel has edgy design.,happy
"This place was perfect for our trip. rooms were very clean and spacious, free breakfast, great location. everything was within walking distance and if it wasn't, the subway stops were just a couple blocks away. most of the staff was very nice. there were a few front desk people that just acted stuck up but lucky for them dumb people like that won't ruin my vacation. but the others were very helpful in recommendations of restaurants and tours. All in all i would recommend this place.",happy
"We stayed here for - nights in October.
Upon checking in we received choc chip cookies seemingly straight out of the oven (very nice touch :) )
Check in was smooth and simple, we had a great view right over Times Square on the --th floor.
I felt that housekeeping was a bit hit or miss, some days they would replace the bathroom soaps and somedays not (a small thing I know), but I also noticed that i'm pretty sure they didn't sweep the bathroom daily as blowdrying my hair would leave hair on the floor and there it would stay accumulating (just one of my gripes).
Being right in Times Square there was anything you needed close by, but of course paying Times Square prices (great breakfast places on -th Avenue without the Times Square prices).
Overall we enjoyed our stay here, I loved looking out the window over Times Square and being right in the middle of it (I didn't notice any noise either)",happy
"The hotel has improved considerably since the renovation. (Ok, it used to be a dump.) Now it is clean, smartly decorated and cool. I had a renovated room with the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I Love New York"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" promotion, so I got a little bag of goodies. The staff even seems to try harder. I'll be back.",happy
"We spent - nights in that hotel. 
Positive Aspects: Well located, nice swimming pool, large parking
Negative Aspects: The Mexican lady at the front desk was agressive, not polite, not even answering when we were asking a question. She gave us a room under the standard we had paid for. Each time we were asking something we had an agressive answer (if answer was given) and very dark looking at us. 
I think that people like her shouldn't work in commercial activity if they don't respect a minimum
customers.
The place does not look safe, I wouldn't advise it for families. 
Regards,",not happy
Very comfortable accommodations in medium-size room. Hotel staff very courteous. Very clean. Liked ambiance in lobby with complimentary wine and cheese. Continental breakfast included good N.Y. pastries. Coffees and cookies available at all times. Computer and printer in lobby for guest's free use.,happy
"We picked this hotel as a romantic holiday getaway. As soon as you walk in, you can feel the warmth of the fireplace and were greeted by a nice staff. Hotel Valet is --.-- but if you park your car yourself in the lot across the street its --.--. It was a good tip given to us by the bell hop. We used the fitness center which is extremely up to date with all new equipment, tvs attached to each machine. We even paid a visit to Asha Salon which is onsite. The entire hotel was redone so everything is brand new and beautiful. Do not expect the largest spaces in the world, but they did a great job of keeping the decor minimal but modern. The location was extremely close to shopping (state street) and to the Daley center for us to be able to visit the Christkindlmarket and check out the giant christmas tree. We ate dinner at Elate restaurant which is next door to the hotel. You do not have to walk outside of the hotel for it. The menu is not the largest in selection, but what we ordered was very tasty. It was a beautiful stay for my husband and I.",happy
Right in the heart of Times Square. We couldn't have asked for a better location. The hotel itself is very charming. Very large bright bathroom an added plus. We enjoyed the complimentary wine and appetizers in the evening and especially appreciated the fresh fruit that was available all day long. The location was exceptional because it provided for a stopping off place where we could quickly drop in and change clothes or drop off our packages. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They pointed us in the direction of several great restaurants. Would definitely return there upon our next visit.,happy
"GReta hotel with fantastic service! PeErfect location for our first time in San Francisco. Close to Union Square and all public transport, attractions and restaurants. Rooms was great - nice and spacious with a separate wardrobe area. Bathrooms could do with some reonvating, but that said everything was in fine working order, just a little dated. Would definately stay there again.",happy
"Read good review about this hotel, and choose based on recommendation. Overall enjoyed a short one-day stay although there are something to be improved.
- Check-in: Had some problem with self check-in (designated room are not ready??) 
- Room: Was relatively OK but have some problem. Broken mug and unfinished vanity area. Also, bathroom was too dark. Have to open the door.
- Wireless Internet: Had some problem when log-in first, but finally able to log in. However, the overall speed was really slow..
- Breakfast: Was really nice breakfast. Hope it opens a bit late than -:--AM.",happy
"This is the best of the best when it comes to Marriott. First of all, every person on the staff goes out of their way to make sure your every need is met. I needed meeting space and the next thing I know we were sitting in the Presidential Suite. The location is great and the hotel has its own private street and excellent valet parking.",happy
We spent one night. The hotel is great and fairly new. The breakfast was not as good as I would have liked as their famous cinnamon rolls were absent. If you stay ask for a room on the back of the hotel as the front is noisy from Mayport Rd.,happy
"We stayed - nights end of May. We got a very large suite, with a full kitchen, outdoor patio, closet, and a safe. Location was very close to a lot of the action, but the hotel didn't get any street noise which was nice. The free breakfast was good. They have a computer and printer that the guests can use. Free underground parking. My only negative comment would be the room wasn't as clean as it could be, I saw some dust in a few corners. But overall I think this hotel is very good value.",happy
"This hotel is a brilliant boutique hotel in a fantastic location for tourists. - minutes from times square but not in the hustle and bustle. -- minute walk to central park, empire state and rockerfeller! Subway stations very close too as well as good restaurants. The hotel was very clean and the staff all very helpful. Upgraded our room and gave a free bottle of champagne for my birthday. 
Breakfast is help yourself continental but was lovely. Although you should get to breakfast before -am as quite busy after that. 
We will definitely stay again if we are lucky enough to be able to go back! Can't recommend highly enough!",happy

We stayed at the Warwick because we wanted to have dinner on top of the space needle - it was a romantic get away! We loved the Warwick - very nice room overlooking the space needle and the sliding door opened so we could get air when we slept. That's important to both of us. Very little noise as we were on the --th floor and we slept very well. Great hotel -- definitely try it!,happy
"After making my reservations for this hotel I decided to check the ratings, and I must say, they made me very nervous. Some ratings were good, but I focused on the bad ones.I decided to keep my reservations mainly because of the good reputations I have heard of the hotel. I am so glad I didl. I loved the hotel and my children loved it too! We all agreed it felt like we were on the Titanic ship. It was so beautiful and elegant. The room was a good size and it was very clean, and I'm a clean freak! I can't wait to come back with my husband for a weekend getaway.",happy
"When it comes to midtown Manhattan there are plenty of options. The Benjamin is trying to stand out as a boutique hotel, but the quality of service does not justify the extra cost. Our room wasn't very clean (lots of dust on the TV and the frames, hair in the bathroom). 
The room was pretty small (even to NY standards) but we had a great balcony with view over midtown and the Waldorf. 
The restaurant, The National, was excellent. The problem was again the service, slow and not very professional.",not happy
"The Sheraton is definitely located in the heart of it all but I was a bit disappointed in the facility itself. As others have stated on this board, the facility is dated. The pictures on Sheraton's website must have been taken right after the renovation was done. The carpeting was worn and unraveling in parts. We had a gorgeous view of Monument Circle but the room window was fogged up either between the panes or very dirty on the outside. The light fixtures and bath fan were also in need of a good cleaning. My real disappointment was with the rooftop pool. The website portrayed the pool area as very nice and beautiful. In reality, it is nothing more than a concrete hole in a vast concrete roof with a few chairs scattered about.
On the plus side, the woman that waited on me during my stay was one of the nicest, most professional front desk people I have ever encountered.",not happy
"We had reserved our room for five days, however we checked out after the first night. Let me first state the good things about this hotel. It has an incredible view of the city and the location can't be beat. These two things were not enough to make us stay in our room which had definitely seen better days. The bed actually sagged in the middle, not terribly, but enough to indicate that it was old and should be replaced. The carpets appeared worn as did everything else. There was a huge cigarette burn mark on the bathroom counter. Hopefully they will renovate when the new tower is finished.",not happy
"We stayed at the Alexis for a couple of reasons--we wanted some place special for my birthday and we liked the location because it's within walking distance of The Brooklyn Restaurant where we had dinner. From start to finish, we enjoyed our whole experience at the Alexis! When we arrived at our room, The Author's Suite, I thought we'd been given the wrong room--I was not expecting such a nice big suite! We had a couple of hours to kill after checking in, so we went down to the Bookstore Bar for a drink and a snack. We sat at an outdoor table on a beautiful summer day, ordered some wonderful ahi tuna and crab cakes and a glass of wine, and relaxed while doing some people watchng. The next day we went to the Library Bistro, a cozy spot for breakfast. I will definitely choose the Alexis again when we visit Seattle!",happy
"Nice Location, - mile from Airport. good value if you just wanna stay overnight for a Early Morning Flight. They have a free Shuttle that runs every half hour to Airport. You can also park in the lot for $-.-- a day. Ruby Tuesday is the only place near for a bite to eat, within Walking distance.",not happy
"Not much to add here: Great hotel with cool amenities.
Rooms tend to be small, but you've got everything you need: Comfy bed... TV if needed... FREE (!) wifi that's actually fast for a hotel (-Mbps down)... free purified chilled water near all elevators... automated check-in-check-out... business center with dedicated boarding pass printing... EXCELLENT location... 
Shares a property with Club Quarters. Not sure how that works out, since it's one building, but no complaints here.",happy
The bed was extremely uncomfortable - hard as a rock. Intresting they try to promote the sale of their bed linens like some other chains. I had a junior suite but it was as cheaply furnished and decorated as a ----'s motel. Poor and general lack of lighting. $-.-- morning cup of coffee at a serve yourself bar by a money anticipated type. The location is excellent but hotel quality and comfort really lacked. Have done much better in Chicago for the same money and location.,not happy

Room was very clean and all furniture was really nice. We had a great view of the river from the --th floor. Bellmen were easy to work with and very accomodating. Location was great for the theatre and shopping. This is the -rd time we have stayed here over the past - years and never have been disappointed.
We would go back here in a heartbeat.",happy
"This review is long overdue.My two young adult children and I had a wonderful stay at Chelsea Pines in August. I did a lot of research before our trip (even emailing someone whose review I read here) and was amazed to find that all of the positive reviews were both true and well deserved. From the moment we first walked through the door, the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We arrived very early, so our luggage was safely stored while we explored NY. When we returned, our luggage was waiting for us in the room. The location is wonderful. Though we did a lot of walking to experience the many varied neighborhoods, subways to everywhere were a block or two away. The immediate surroundings offer a variety of excellent dining options( listen to the Chelsea Pines staff recommendations! They are great!) and I felt safe walking on the surrounding streets both day and night. Breakfast is varied, fresh, and delicious. In additiion to fruit, cheese, cereal and yogurt,Jay bakes a different kind of bread each day.The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""suite"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" was clean and plenty big enough for the three of us.The inroom Nespresso machines were addictive!

"I am not a complainer, BUT this was nowhere I would stay ever again. VERY SMALL HOTEL, SMALL ROOM , Terrible view. We had such a small window in our room that faced steel emergency stairs on the outside. the house keeping ladies were so loud the entire time they cleaned, banging door, vacuum, banging noises. We also had a housekeeper ask us for our room number - times In row so she could clean our room. I explained to her we just got here and our room was fine. She insisted we give her the room number. I felt that was so very weird and creepy. I notified front desk, they didn't seem like they cared. This was not a cozy feeling hotel either. Cheap rates, I guess you get what you pay for. Will never stay here again.",not happy
"I'm a member of Starwood Preferred Guest, so always look for a Sheraton or Westin when I take trips so I can use the points. This looks like a pretty new Westin and in my opinion looks like the nicest hotel in downtown Memphis - not counting the historic Peabody of course. 
One thing that drives me crazy is how much you have to park at hotels. They charge $-- - day to park in their garage. I used points, but this isn't a cheap hotel, and it seems like the more you spend for a room at some places, the more they keep getting you everywhere else! 
I also am disappointed that they charge so much for breakfast. I never can understand that you can spend $-- at a Holiday Inn Express - Hampton Inn, but you still get a free breakfast. When you stay at a hotel like this- you pay $--- - night and then they want you to pay $-- for a breakfast the next morning.
The room we had was really nice. No complaints. Very spacious, with a comfortable bed, big bathroom, nice amenities and cool view overlooking the FedEx Forum and Gibson Guitar Factory. Great location -- Beale Street is just around the corner. Great place if you plan on spending a lot of time in downtown Memphis - within walking distance. 
A couple service issues - concierge was not very knowledgable in terms of restaurant recommendations. Also, I went down there to ask for some more coffee for our room, since all they had was decaf, and there was no one at the front desk for about -- minutes. I found this mind boggling. Literally no one anywhere. There was also an elevator out which made the wait for the other one pretty long. 
Other than that, it's still a really nice hotel, the people were friendly and it's a good location for downtown Memphis.",not happy

"I stayed here in Feb of ----. I had read all the reviews ahead of time and was a bit freaked out. When I got there after a - hour plane ride and a motion sick Taxi ride from the airport I was in a bad mood and felt like crap. But I walked in with my bags and did have to wait in line for a while to get my key. I went up to my floor and was a bit freaked out. The hall ways are scary and you think a ghostly little girl will pop out at anytime. I got to my room and it did smell like smoke but I was ok with that seeing as I am a smoker. I checked the sheets and bed for bed bugs and stains and I found none. The bathroom was so so. It was clean but really outdated. The shower had good temp and pressure. The sheets where changed daily and the room cleaned. I had no issue with staying here. I am -- and have been around the world It was just as good as some of the hostiles I stayed at in downtown paris. I would recomend if you do not mind non flashy things and needed a place to stay that is close,cheap and you wont spend a ton of time in. Nothing wrong with this hotel other then what I said. Yes It does need some help but it is going to be demolished soon sadly :(",happy
"My stay in this hotel was one of the worst experience ever. The management staff is arrogant, lobby is in under construction and I strongly suggest to avoid this locati on.

The breakfast, afternoon wine and cheese and services are excellent. The room is comfortable that made a big different when you traveling, you feel almost like to stay at home. I am highly recomend this hotel to everyone whomever is making the vacation plan visit New York. Nolitan Hotel location is convience and easy to get every where. For sure, we will choose to stay at Nolitan again when we plan our next visit to New York. Thanks again to all the staffs for your warmest hospitality and great services.",happy
"Just got back from a week at the Murray Hill Inn. We chose this hotel from the reviews on trip advisor, as they all said pretty much the same thing: a good, bargain hotel in a good location.
We'd read that the hotel doesn't have an elevator so we came prepared with a backpack rather than the suitcase and we'd suggest others do the same. The room was a bit small, but hey, from what I hear that's the norm for Manhattan. Importantly though it was clean. We'd also read from the hundreds of other reviews we'd scoured that bed bugs are a big problem in Manhattan (it was actually on the news while we were there!), but we were fine. I did a suspicious check on the night we arrived and there were none to be seen.
The bathroom was excellent - it was very clean. The shower had excellent pressure and stayed at a constant temperature; it was by far one of the best showers we've ever encountered in our hotel travels. The towels were white and fluffy, if a little small.
The noise from outside was no problem. We were expecting it to be very loud but it wasn't at all. The only thing we noticed was the heating system clanked and wheezed a bit - it didn't trouble us but it might annoy others.
The reception staff were very helpful and friendly - we arrived at the hotel very late on the first night (at about midnight) but it was no problem. They also helped us on the last day when there was an error with our airport transfer - thanks again for that!
Finally, another of the hotel's advantages is the location. It's just around the corner from the Empire State Building and Macy's and the --th street subway is only - blocks down for when you want to go elsewhere. We would also recommend the Brasil Coffee House on the corner of --th and Lexington (a few doors down) for morning coffee-tea with a smile.
Overall - a basic hotel, but for a good price. Clean rooms, helpful staff and good location.",happy
"Ok well let me start off by saying they STOLE my laptop. Yeah they did the Key test and as i expected - everything came out pointing to ME. Only my key entered the room, what a coinsidence. Im not surprised. When i went to the Front desk and let them know what happened, they looked at each other as to SAY not again - they must get this alot. I still have not heard from the MANAGER or still have not gotten a detail journal from the entries to my ROOM. I believe they HAVE Theifs working for them. BEWARE - TAKE YOUR STUFF with you when you leave your room. Don't buy there EXCUSE that you must have left the door open. I am not the only VICTIM. Lets invest in some security camera on the hallways huh. This is obviously a trend among your employees.",not happy
"My husband and I arrived at LAX at --:-- PM from the east coast, so being very tired we were happy that we didn't have to wait more than -- minutes for the shuttle to the Super -( the driver was very friendly). Luckily I had put their number in my cell phone before we left home because our luggage pick up got moved to terminal - to one of the baggage claim areas where we had to walk about - minutes outside to get there. Upon arriving there I didn't see the courtesy phones that the hotel told me to use to call them. The hotel itself was very basic, about what you would expect from a Super -. The room was very basic, but clean and looked as if it had been recently painted. We were so tired we didn't hear any planes, but we also got up early to get started on our vacation. The breakfast was very skimpy, a few cereals and breads and pastries. No fresh fruit or yogurt , but what really bothered me was the pitcher they kept refilling with milk looked like it had not been cleaned in weeks and the lady working at the desk was not at all friendly. The plus side of this budget motel is the fact that it is right across the street from Avis Car Rental and a few blocks from Budget, which happens to be across the street from the Marriott Renaissance. We had rented from Budget and so after breakfast we just walked ( about - minutes) to the Budget lot, rented our car and drove back to the Super - and check out and were on our way! I did ask if their shuttle could drop us off at the Budget lot on it's way to the airport and was told """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""No"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in no uncertain terms!",not happy
"We arrived after a very long day of travel... Check In was quick but there was not a cart for our luggage and cooler.. so many trips back and forth to the car. The room was a suite... the chair in the living are was dirty and the mattress on the pull out bed was not comfortable at all. Overall the room was clean, bed was comfortable, the pool outdoors was cool but the hot tub was hot. Breakfast was nice, the room got really busy as there was a school band there at the same time. Need an over flow room for breakfast. Very close to highway I--- but if I had not called for directions off the highway i would have had a very difficult time finding the hotel.
I would stay here again... NO pets are allowed here- FYI...",happy
"Our family of four stayed - nights at the Carlyle Suites near Dupont Circle in Washington and had an outstanding experience. The hotel is very clean, the rooms are spacious, and the price was affordable compared to all other places we researched. The location isn't bad at all. An easy ride on the red line puts you in Dupont circle, and you can easily walk a half mile to the hotel. Upon check in, Jordan at the front desk answered our every question and was extremely polite and helpful. You can walk to the White house, only about a mile. And after a long day of seeing the sites, the tempurpedic beds are a welcome sight!! We would recommend the Carlyle to any family staying in the DC area. We would stay again in a heartbeat.",happy
"Great location to everything. Can walk to all the restaurants, bars and a shopping mall in the Gaslamp District. The room was very nicely decorated with a very comfortable bed. The only thing I didn't like was the bathroom sink. It looked very trendy: square, above counter mounted, but so shallow the water went everywhere and trying to shave was very challenging. Free internet if you sign up with Kimpton. The pool area on the -th floor rooftop was very nice with a great bar area and lots of seating. The hotel had a complementary wine hour in the lobby area which was a very nice touch. My only complaint would be the valet only parking at $---night. Very expensive. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",happy
"I'm planning a trip to NY in May and the Omni was in my top - hotels that I was researching to stay at. It's my first time to NY so I wanted to make sure I did my research when it came to hotels. I was deeply concerned about the Construction that was underway so I just called the hotel. 
I spoke with someone named Peaches who was completely unprofessional, unfriendly and rude. I understand it's -am in NY right now but you'd think that they'd have someone decent representing their hotel since that could very well be the first impression.
Anyhow she asked who I wanted to be connected to and when I told her reservations, she said they were closed until -am. Okay, that's understandable. I continue to ask her about the construction - she proceeded to talk to me like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" was inconveniencing her and put me on hold without sayiing she was going to gather information. I thought she hung up. She picked up the line and then put me on hold again without saying anything, how do I know? Well because I heard her talking to someone else. 
She said that they would be completely finished with the construction in July and had no additional information to give me.
If this is how the customer service is going to be over the phone - I really don't think I'll be staying there. It's really horrible..I was hoping to try a new hotel.
I was wavering on the reservation due to the construction but the customer service completely threw me over the edge. I guess I'll stay somewhere else.",not happy
"As a meeting and event planner this hotel tops the list.
In the spring I planned my company’s annual global sales meeting for -- people. We had domestic and international professionals attending and my task was to find a location where everyone could stay and that offered the meeting and business needs of my group. 
I had a total of -- people booked at the hotel for seven days, and every single person raved about the exceptional service, the beautiful rooms, and extraordinary attentiveness to detail the hotel provided. 
During the daily meetings the conference room was beautiful stocked with teas, coffee, water, candies and never did anything go empty. We elected to have breakfast, lunches and snacks provided for our meeting and the food was always beautifully presented, delicious, and the staff that oversaw our meetings and meals made sure everything was on target and ran without a hitch. 
During one of our days a new product was presented and the staff at the hotel wanted to make it a “special” event so they provided a lovely candy and treat display as a much appreciated and enjoyed bonus. Additionally, the gave our group a complimentary champagne reception in celebration of our product launch. 
The valet staff was warm and helpful, and when our cars were brought to us they were stocked with water bottles – prefect for the drive home for our local staff. Concierge Managed transportation for us for our offsite events, and as with every other detail, the hotel never missed a beat. 
It’s not easy to find a location that offers everything you are looking for, and does it with charm, class and attention to their guests. Hotel ---- knows how to do it, and does it well! If you are looking for a place for a business meeting, or just a wonderful getaway for pleasure, you’d be remiss not to stay at this hotel.",happy
"My grandson and I stayed here for - nights before our Disney Cruise and for one night after. Yes, they are renovating, but nothing about the renovation interfered with our enjoyment. Rooms are spacious, clean and well appointed.
The staff are incredbily accommodating and the breakfast in the morning was a welcome treat. The location was fine, the hotel itself charming, and we had a great - days there. I would absolutely stay there again!",happy
"What a beautiful hotel and AWSOME location. Right in the middle of down town San Francisco. Located on Market street, a main road through downtown, this hotel is a very old hotel but has wonderful charm. 
REMEMBER THAT THIS IS PART OF THE LUXURY COLLECTION HOTELS!!
Valet parking is VERY expensive, $-- +tax a day with in and out privledges but we never needed our car. There is NO self parking. The valet guys and the doormen were more that willing to help you with any directions that you need.
The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""F"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" cable car will take you down to Fisherman's Warf. To pick up the car you cross Market Street to the depot. Cost is $-.-- a person and the ticket you get is usually good for - or so hours so be sure to hold onto it. The only problem with this mode of transportation is that once you get down to the Warf it is really difficult to get back. We waited over -- minutes for a car to come and finally decided to walk back. It's about a - hour walk but very, very enjoyable, just be sure to get a map form the hotel before you venture out. 
There are alot of bums in the area which was a little wierd but I guess that you get that is a big city. They really weren't a problem.
There is a lot just in the hotel area to keep you busy. The genuine cable cars run in the area which was really fun to see. Union Square is a must. Like I said before, be sure to get a street map at the hotel it will REALLY help people that have never been to the area before. 
Now to the hotel itself. Very nice but.........the sheets are AWFUL!! They felt like paper and the bed was old and VERY uncomfortable. When you are staying in a -+ star hotel and may be paying alot of money then why can't EVERYTHING be top of the line?? We are Starwood Gold members and so we were hoping for some sort of an upgrade. When we checked in we went to the preferred check in area and were told that we were given a superior king room. Cool right??? Well, wrong. When we entered the room it was a little small, understandable as to the location of this hotel and space is at a premium in the city. The room and bathroom were nice but cramped. When we looked out the window all that we could see was a part of the hotel. Brick wall with windows of other rooms. We thought if this is what gold and a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""superior"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room (To get gold status you have to either spend $--,--- or spend -- nights in any SPG property in a years time. Not that easy.) then we wonder what a normal not updated room was like. Don't get me wrong, the room was nice, it had its small problems but it was still nice. 
Room service which we didn't use seemed VERY expensive by looking at the menu. We visited the bar, Maxfield's to have a couple of drinks. We sat at the bar and waited several minutes to get waited on. We finally ordered and they also gave us a bowl of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""snack"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" type chips. As we were sitting there enjoying ourselves we noticed that when people left they took the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""snack"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" bowls and emptied part of the chips leaving some in and then refilled them....without washing them!!!! OMG!!! We talked to a rude manager and he said that he would take care of it. So BEWARE of Maxfield's and the drinks were VERY expensive around $---- for liquor and $--- a beer. That was the only experience we had with dining. We did notice that the buffet in the morning was around $----- a person. We went to the Starbucks and the McDonalds down the street instead. There is also a Del Taco, Subway, Westfield shopping center and several other stores and restaurants in the area. Also if you are down at the Warf go to Chippino restaurant and eat. VERY GOOD!! 
Just remember that you are smack dab in downtown and this is a great location. Just beware that if you are spending a lot of money that it's not always what you think it is. You also have to remember that you basically need to add $-- a day +TAX to the room for parking. We don't think that we would stay here again as I'm sure that there are other hotels in the area that may be just as good if not better that we would investigate first. Don't be fooled by the name or the look. It was a great experience but not really worth it. 
Sorry that this review is so long but if you are about to spend the money to stay here we wanted to make sure that you know what to expect.",not happy
"My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House for seven nights during the Thanksgiving holiday. Let me point out that Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House - a New York outfit bought it a couple of years ago. They're undergoing a huge $--- million renovation and the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Chicago"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" charm is being killed off in favor of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""New York-New York!!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" No offense, but if I want to go to New York City, I'll go. 
I have stayed at the Palmer House dozens of times in the last -- years. The last time prior to this visit was in ----. We decided to give the Palmer House one more try. While the ---- visit certainly lacked lustre, this visit was awful! I remember the graciousness of the hotel. Seeing all the staff happy and better yet, happy to see you! Now - we got the distinct impression we were a bother. The bellmen (and I use the term loosely) look at you when you walk it like you're cramping their style. We saw older guests lugging their cases up the steps, while the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""bellmen"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" yacked on with eachother!! In the entire week we were there, no one opened the door for us - no one greeted us. Shame on these new owners. Don't they know the first thing about customer service? First impressions? Evidently not.
The first room they gave us had a terrible stagnant water smell coming from the bathroom drains. It was horrible and kept us up at night. Furthermore, the carpet had not been vacuumed and the bathroom floor and mirrors were not clean. We had to call housekeeping three times. Each time they would come, they didn't correct the problems! We gave up. We tried to change rooms but were told the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""We're completely sold out..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" line. We made our reservations for this trip in July!! We're Hilton Honors members - who cares! Anyway, the next day, we changed rooms and while the room was better, we still experienced problems with water, for instance, on two mornings, the water ran brown with silt! Not good.
The restaurant """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Lockwood"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" did not open until Thanksgiving Day, despite being advertised as opening weeks before. We made reservations there for dinner several weeks prior. I must say, the retaurant is terrible!! The whole layout stinks! The ceilings are far too low, the tables are bare, no table cloths, no flowers, no candles. Stark. The flow of the restaurant is tangled at best. No one knows which way to go while making their way to the buffet, which is situated at the far end of the long and narrow restaurant. It's a zig-zig game getting to and from. Not only that, but we ate there for breakfast each morning (simply because our rate included it) and the congestion at the buffet and lack of service was miserable. There are plenty of waiters hanging about, but I don't think the manager has told them what to do yet!! No salt and pepper shakers and silverware one morning. No coffee the next morning. Funny enough, we spoke to the manager of the restaurant and he admitted to us that the restauarnt had been designed by people who had no restaurant planning experience!! No kidding. I'd avoid this place. To think the hotel closed the wonderful French Quarter Restaurant and opened this??!! Unforgivable!! One more thing about this restaurant. The weird music choice. Who wants to hear Janice Joplin while eating Thanksgiving Dinner - or any other time for that matter!! The music was awful. Rap, New Age, Rock, ect. The manager said they were playing the staff's CD's. Wwhhhhaaat??? 
For a good restaurant, try Petterino's, The South Water Kitchen (WONDERFUL!!) and Harry Caray's. There's also a Corner Bakery that serves good coffee, sandwiches and pastries.
Lastly, the decor is no longer tasteful. The lobby looks awful with a bar sticking out in the middle and massive yellow chairs obstructing the once lovely view. There are people guzzling drinks and half eaten plates of food cluttering up tables - in the lobby!! Dreadful. No relaxation there at all anymore. You cannot even walk through it. It's a circus. The carpet choice on the floors we were on -- and then -- is hideous! I describe at as the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""stone-out peacock of pinball wizardry"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". I have a feeling Potter Palmer would flip if he saw this mess!
What are these new owners thinking??? A staff member told us the new owners also bought the old Carson Pirie Scott building directly across the street, which closed in February. I shutter to think.....
Well, with Marshall Field's selling out to Macy's, Carson's closed the Berghoff Restaurant closed, Trader Vic's closed and now the Palmer House in complete shambles...... Chicago is sinking fast. We sure hate to see it go..... What's next, are they going to raze Wrigley Field now? They seem to be the last man standing. Good-bye Chicago.
We did decide on one thing. No more Hilton Hotels for us. Even though Hilton no longer owns the Palmer House, their name is still attached. We're sticking with Marriott, who is fabulous. (We made the switch after our Palmer House trip three years ago)
There are plenty of hotel choices in Chicago. We stayed at the Marriott Renaissance last year and it was great. If we ever get up the nerve to come back to Chicago, that's where we'll be staying.",not happy
"Stayed several nights at this hotel. Found the location very good - close to a good selection of restaurants and a Metro station. Felt safe walking in the area after dark. Our room was large with a very comfortable bed and chairs. Enjoyed the wine reception at -pm each day. The hotel is pet friendly so expect to see dogs in the lobby. All we met were well-behaved and charming. Had daily interactions with the front desk and found the staff to be exceptional. They were friendly, helpful, and courteous. Will plan to stay at this hotel again. Only complaint is the lack of a coffee maker in the room. Coffee was available in the lobby in the morning but a coffee maker in the room is my preference.",happy
"Beds felt like a brick. The toilets flushing on the --nd floor can be heard n the --st. The pipes are old so when people shower early in the morning it sounds like siren. Woke me up every morning around -. Rooms are old and feeli like they need an upgrade. Gym is good and well equipped. Concierge level was crowded so did not use it after the first visit as it took me -- minutes to get a drink. The view restaurant food is ok but not worth --- dollars. I won't be staying here again as it was unpleasant. Room service food is expensive and poor quality. I'm a loyal Marriott gold member, but this feels like a old Courtyard so for those expecting JW quality you are going to be very unhappy.",not happy

"Good price, good location, good service, very pleased. Only problem was a -- minute wait to get linens in the evening. Otherwise, everything was very good. Rooms are well decorated and charasterically small as is common in NYC.",happy
"This is my second stay in the dream downtown. I will rate my first visit as decent, I got a good deal and the location is fabulous. I decided I could overlook the intense club-like vibe and overwhelming cologne smell in the lobby... because who doesn't want to stay in a spaceship for a few nights? 
Then came my second visit, two words: bad dream. First of all, a warning: If you value sleep do not stay on the --th floor. There is a club on the --th and you can count on the noise going until at least -:--am (I should note, I am not a light sleeper). Today, after a long day of meetings I was looking forward to coming up to my room to relax, NOT SO FAST! Guess what? The walls are paper thin! You idiot, you just moved to the fourth floor but you had better pray that your neighbors are quiet and go to bed at a reasonable hour, or that you have the same taste in music. If like me, however, they decided to crank up the techno music and bring the party to their room, count yourself in as their plus one and hang on for a ride into the middle of the night listening to your walls shake as they yell to be heard. 
I should note: I called the front desk and they sent security, this didn't really do much. The biggest issue is honestly the paper thin walls. It is kind of unreal how much you can hear, every word (so if you plan on having sex or private conversations, take note it will be a community experience for your neighbors).
At this point, I am beyond exhausted. I am paying a premium and haven't slept in two days. Being a frequent business traveller to NYC, I love a good deal that is in this neighborhood, but at this rate you couldn't pay me to return to the dream downtown.
Yes it's trendy, yes you might think $----$--- a night is a good deal... but do not be fooled. Unless your only plan is to party all night and sleep during the day (when it actually was quite peaceful) find another location!
Dream hotel = disaster.",not happy

Enjoyed the breakfast and liked that they had eggs and bacon available everyday.
The staff was nice and the hotel was clean.
The room was fine but a better desk chair would have made it better.
We were attending meetings in uptown (downtown) Charlotte and stayed each night to have dinner. It did seem that the hotel did not have great proximity to restaurants.
I would certainly stay here again.",happy
"Stayed in this hotel for - night in a king suite. We had booked a deal through wotif that stated --am check-in & -pm checkout - this worked perfectly for us as we arrived early morning after a long flight from Australia. When we arrived our room wasn't ready - they didn't seem to have any idea that the deal was listed on Wotif. We went for a wonder & had breakfast & our room was ready when we returned at about --.--am. The room was big, a separate bedroom to living area & we had a view of the Hollywood sign! Bed was extremely comfortable, not much other furniture in the room. Nothing wrong with the accommodation, good location if you are wanting to be in Hollywood, we weren't too keen on the area. We had a drink by the pool which was nice, good atmosphere. 
We checked with reception on the day we were to leave that the -pm checkout would be honoured (That was listed on our paperwork). The best they could do was -pm - this was ok with us but I think they need to look at what is being advertised on their suppliers websites as its false advertising!",not happy
"We stayed at this hotel for - nights and had a great time. We had a suite on the -th floor with a great view out of the large corner window. Only downside was that the fire station is close and the engines roar thro at all times of the day with sirens going. However, I would not have swapped the room for a quieter one as the advantages outweigh the disadvantage. The rooms were very well appointed and maintained and had everything we needed. The complimentary breakfast is a major plus, although the 'hot' food is not very adventurous but the waffle maker, cereals, fruits, cakes and breads etc more than make up for it, there is something for everyone to give them a good start. The tea- coffee etc in the foyer is available free of charge all day and they usually have complimentary cloudy lemonade and fresh cookies between -pm and -pm.. brilliant! During the - days we encountered differing attitudes at the reception desk but most of the staff were helpful and friendly.
The location is very good for exploring the sights with the metro a couple of blocks away and the whitehouse and the mall about ----- mins easy walk away. There are plenty of food establishments around but not sure about top end restaurants. Personally we were not looking for -star restaurants or hotel and the Hampton would not be classified as such. It is a good quality --- star which is an excellent base for exploring Washington, afterall who wants to luxuriate in their room when you have a terrific city to explore!!
Very pleased with this hotel and would definately recommend it to anyone not looking for - star accomodation, we would definately stay here again.",happy
"We spent the first - nights of our honeymoon in New York and stayed at the Affinia Shelburne. Our first impression was that the hotel was very clean and the reception staff gave us a very warm welcome. They then sprang a lovely surprise on us by presenting us with a bottle of champagne and giving us the most beautiful suite on the top floor.
Our room was fabulous and incredibly large and comfortable. It had a bedroom, bathroom, lounge - dining room and a kitchenette. The best surprise of all was when we realised we had a balcony which we could walk out onto and sit to enjoy the most fabulous view of the New York skyline. We had a view of the Empire State building straight ahead and out towards the Chrysler building on the side. How fantastic to sit on a balcony, sipping champagne and enjoying this view.
It is far enough away from the busy areas of Manhattan to be quieter but at the same time we were able to walk to Times Square and the Theatre district in about -- minutes. Plenty of taxis out on Lexington Ave too if you dont want to walk.
This is a great hotel in New York - friendly staff, great location, lovely room and competitively priced. We totally recommend it!",happy

the room was very spacious, clean, and comfortable. with a full kitchen, fireplace, sofa-living room area.
free parking & free wifi (which worked great). friendly & helpful staff. incredible price.
only suggestion i have is to provide """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""do not disturb"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" signs so housekeeping doesn't come knocking at noon.
would stay again for sure if i needed a hotel in the area.",happy
"Our family recently returned from a one-nighter in Baltimore after staying at the Marriott Courtyard Downtown. Our stay was complimentary as an incentive for acquiring the Marriott Rewards Visa card. Nice perk.
Over the years we have stayed at some of the other properties in the harbor area such as:
Hyatt Regency Baltimore
Holiday Inn Downtown
Renaissance Harborplace
Baltimore Marriott Waterfront
As a comparison point, we were happy with the Courtyard in terms of its cleanliness and great location and see it as a decent option. The hotel is situated on Aliceanna Street near the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Little Italy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" area. There are quite a number of nice condominiums and hotels nearby as well as some brand name stores such as Haagen-Daas, Starbucks, etc. You have a nice walk (about -- minutes) to the National Aquarium, water taxis and the other amenities nearby. It can get pretty hot during the summer but its manageable. 
Check-in was smooth and the staff were friendly. The lobby was comfortable with the standard """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Courtyard Cafe"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", an attractive bar area and lounge. Our room was large and very clean with the fourth floor offering balcony views of the harbor and the area skyline. 
The fourth floor is also home to a nicely landscaped patio section complete with an indoor pool and fitness center. It's a rather large space where you face an an adjacent office complex connected to the hotel. It's attractive yet somewhat strange to peer in on folks hard at work during your leisure. 
On the downside, this is not a full-service property so there is no one to help with bags and, if you go on the weekend, a strong possibility of no baggage carts readily available. Our breakfast buffet was comped due to very slow service. The staff also seemed stressed and a little inexperienced. It wasn't a big deal as everyone was nice.
Overall, this hotel is a notch above the standard """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Marriott Courtyard"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but is notihing fancy. I would rank it as a - --- star and a solid choice despite being a few blocks off the water. We were happy and could see us staying again in the future.",happy
"Yeah I know this place was built in ----, and it says it is still decorated in that type of decor.... BUT they could have at least made the bathroom usable. The sink and tub are rusty and moldy. The mattresses are like sleeping on a hard wood floor. No air or heat, no in room TV or radio & like two electrical outlets in the entire room. Just overall disgusting. Front desk staff was rude, with his feet kicked up on the counter watching TV & eating a big plate of rice and beans. You can bet I WILL NEVER stay here again or recommend this dump, with the rudest staff.",not happy

"Good value for money when compared to the other -more expensive and often more dated- hotels on Michigan Ave. Great location across Grant Park and close to the major landmarks of Chicago. The bar downstairs serves good breakfast, and staff were very friendly, both in the bar and in the hotel.
The bathroom could have been cleaner, but it wasn't dirty. The room itself was spacious and very clean!",happy
"My standard size room was so spacious that it seemed like a suite. The floor to ceiling window covered almost the entire end of the room -- probably -- feet or so in length -- and allowed lots of light in the room, although the room darkening drapes could be pulled when you wanted to block the morning sun. The large bathroom had a vanity-dressing area and a nice marble style counter, with a separate toilet-shower area.
The service was among the best I have received, with extra special touches like having the front desk call my room an hour or so after check in to ask if I was finding everything okay and to ask if I needed anything else. Later when I needed to go to someplace in town, I was offered a private car shuttle on a gratuity only basis, and I was told they would come pick me up when I was ready as well.
The restaurant food was above average and the prices were very reasonable, even for room service.
The Warwick has great service and is a great value. I highly recommend it.",happy
"The position is great. The rooms are spacious but there are some drawbacks. The lobby is like the departure lounge of a busy airport. The room service is extremely expensive. The concierge is overworked and needs to be chased up. However, the pluses considerably outweigh the minuses.",happy
"It is so hard to find a good hotel in NYC, when you're going in blind. My brother picked this hotel, he and his wife stayed in one room, my mom and I stayed in another. NYC hotel rooms are notoriously small, these were very generous, could easily have accommodated - more people and still not gotten in each other's way, Full bathroom, lots of room to put your toiletries down. You can request your choice of type of pillow! Good front desk, attractive lobby. Not happy that you had to pay like $- for -- minutes of computer time but maybe this is normal in the city? Only complaint but for me was a big one, was the location. It was a -- minute walk to attractions, and had to cab it more than I would have liked. Aside from that, I would have stayed here again, when I visited the next month.",happy

"My wife and I chose the Lombardy for three nights because my daughter's wedding was held next door, at the Arts Club (another pretty special place). From now on, regardless of my reason for visiting DC, I will return to this wonderful boutique hotel. Everyone was delightful, our small suite overlooking the park was very nice (although the closet was very tight & a higher floor may have been a bit quieter). Most of all, we enjoyed the pleasant and helpful staff. How about this???

That takes """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""on the house"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to a new level in the hotel industry. We only ate breakfast in the restaurant but it was exceptional.

"This Hotel cannot fail. Its Location makes it an obvious and irresistable place to stay. That is the root of its problem. Or more accuratly its customers problem. The Room was generous in size, with a sitting room and kitchenette. 
However, Wifi is unacceptable for this day and age. They use the the adjoining RV park system which is poor. the Bar is tired and closes early. All of this could be understood but the attitude of the Staff should overcome all of these things. I say should because my experience was that they did not really care. They were uninspired and that is a management issue. The business knows that tourists will come anyway. These leads to a complacent team that does the bare minimum. This could be a great experience. If you are staying at the heartbreak hotel you are looking for a particular experience. It needs the staff to realise and share in this. I've never heard a free ride in a pink cadillac described in such unenthusiastic tones. Its hard to convey but they almost put you off. It was the only time we felt unwelcome during a - week tour of Kentucky and Tennessee.",not happy
"I cannot understand how various travel sites give the W New York a four star rating. At best, this one deserves three and that's being generous. This hotel's rooms are extremely small and not at all designed with a guest's comfort or needs in mind. There was not one drawer -- even in the deeply scratched desk or nightstand -- in the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""spectacular"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room we booked for three nights. This was a two level upgrade above the even tinier """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cozy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""wonderful"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" levels. We referred to the room as our spectacular closet. Folded clothing was supposed to go into the narrow cubbies of a fabric hanging shelf thing, sold in home stores as a device in which to stack shoes. They hung this improvised dresser from the closet rod and it ate up half of the closet space. The bathroom was also miniscule with just a stall shower with no tub, and it smelled musty because there's no ventilation. When I complained about the smell which was reminiscent of old, wet towels, they sent someone from housekeeping to spray some heavily perfumed air freshener which just made it worse. The ambiance is pretentious and the place tries way too hard to be...I'm not quite sure what it's trying to be. 
On the plus side: the beds are comfortable, the Bliss toiletries are nice and the location can't be beat. The Waldorf, a Marriott, Doubletree, Kimberly Suites and the Benjamin are all within a block of this hotel and I'd opt for one of these before ever returning to this particular W. Very disappointing.",not happy
"I have stayed at this property several times. Starting June - the property came under new management. Before it was a great place to stay with friendly managers, clearn rooms, etc. Now with the new management, they jack you around with the rates - changing even after quoting a price, post notes on your door to come and pay them before the money is due, etc. The feel has really changed in this once very nice place.",not happy
"I stayed here over the weekend. The hotel was friendly, quiet and the staff were really helpful. The room was spacious and modern. Really comfortable. Breakfast is a little basic, cereal, yogurt, fruit and waffles.
As a single female traveller the location wasn't ideal as Ellis street is located near a couple of soup kitchens which made the surrounding area (Tenderloin area) a bit intimidating to a non-local. That said, the hotel staff were great at advising which streets were more tourist-friendly, also providing a free shuttle bus to key locations and I didn't have any problems walking the advised routes. Union street is just -- mins walk away. However if I were to visit San Franzi again I'd probably look for something nearer to North Beach as it was a shame to have to be so cautious when going for a stroll.",happy
"Believe it or not this is all true. I'm here on business and have a sore throat and probably caught a cold. It's freezing in this room and I'm still here as I write this. I'm writing because nobody here will fix the problems.
First two nights, the room was freezing, in the --'s. I called down and engineering told me that the hotel is on air conditioning only - so turning the heat on will only blow cold air - until October --! I asked for a heater and he said we can only send up blankets. So that was day one - walking around with a blanket over my head and wrapped around me.
Day two: -am I call because I'm freezing. They said they have a massive group checking out and more heaters became available, and they'd send one """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""right up"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". They credited me one night stay.
---pm: Still no heater. I called down and with profuse apologies housekeeping sent one up - credited me a -nd night stay. The heater worked for all of - hours and broke. Telephone was broken (handset) so I had to use the portable phone to call and ask for the phone to be replaced.

Oh also I was told the manager was very concerned and would call within three minutes - still have not heard.
Last night my girlfriend tried to take a bath - and the hot water wasn't working. Completely exhausted, we curled up in the freezing room. 
Two nights no heat in a freezing room. No hot water in the tub. Phone is broken. Requests that go unanswered. Welcome to the Waldorf Astoria!",not happy

In December ----, I checked out three boutique hotels in Manhattan. Out of the three, I enjoyed the Library Hotel for its quality service, scrumptious breakfasts and most of all, its decor and book motif. 
Staying here made me feel at home even though I was in the heart of New York's nerve center. While I found the Library to convenient for my family, I think it's perfect for the business traveler and couples.",happy
"Great location (--th & -th), really close to everything. Hotel still undergoing renovation but renovated rooms are cool. Small, but decent for NYC. Looked clean on first glance but then we found a sock which didn't belong to us, so we became a bit suspicious...! Also, things are just shabby around the edges - no accessible powerpoints, even when you find them half don't work. 
It's a decent hotel and great for a short stay, especially for the price, but just don't expect the earth. We found the concierge useless, and we found the luggage porters were not shy of asking for tips which we found a little forward. But otherwise, staff were very nice, it's convenient, and you'll have a good stay there.",not happy

The location in Beacon Hill is an ideal base for exploring Boston.
I highly recommend the Liberty!!",happy
"I had booked this room in anticipation of flight cancellations due to weather. This eventuality did happen. I requested early check in and extra feather pillows. Both requested were granted at no additional charge. The room was spotless; the bed was extremely comfortable. The one slight drawback was the noise of the airplanes taking off, but eventually it abated. I ordered room service. It was extremely prompt and the presentation was wonderful. The buffet breakfast the next morning was plentiful with a nice variety to please all tastes. Every person on staff was extremely friendly and courteous. I will definitely stay her again.",happy
"I stayed at the Westin Tabor Center for one night on a business trip and was not impressed. I'm pretty sure this is the worst Westin I've ever stayed at. 
The employee at check-in was neither personable or helpful. She took about -- minutes to check me in which should really only take up to - minutes. She also didn't have anywhere to recommend for dinner. I don't know if I got stuck with a room that has yet to be renovated or if they just did a shabby job at renovating my room. There were stains on the furniture and all sorts of hair on the bed when I arrived. The hair was definitely not my own! There was trash throughout the room that was presumably left by the person(s) who stayed in the room before me which housekeeping overlooked before I arrived. It is not very welcoming to arrive in a hotel room that is more or less dirty. My coworker also stayed at the hotel and that room was cleaner and nicer than mine. 
On the plus side the room was spacious as was the bathroom. The hotel is situated downtown near restaurants and shopping. There were lots of dining options. I was at the hotel for less than -- hours so I didn't experience the rest of the hotel. This hotel really made me not want to return to another Westin for a while.",not happy

Upon check in, we had two queens that were too soft ( have a bad back) and front desk kindly moved us to another room, where beds were more firm. Hotel is very well managed, have committed staff, and this is why they consistently are rated very well. Location is very central to theatres, times square, walkable to central park ( -- min), empire state building (-- min). Grayline sight seeing bus across the street, as well as Bikram Yoga NYC.

"My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon. We wanted a comfortable luxury hotel that was close to the Mag. Mile. We were able to get a Corner King on the --st floor. It was a great view. 
The pluses
-Amazing bed
-The shower was very lavish
-Hotel staff were very helpful
-Breakfast (free if you make your reservations online) was delicious and very filling
-Location (near Mag Mile with a Whole Foods around the corner for easy snacks)
-MP- docking station was a nice add on
-The gym was sufficient for a quick workout
-The Spa was helpful and my massage felt wonderful after alot of walking around Chicago and my wife enjoyed her manicure and facial. 
Minuses 
-The second floor entrance was a slight problem but nothing that you can't handle
-The ceilings were much to look at
-The Spa prices were higher than we were used to but seemed to be inline with downtown Chicago. 
So as you can see I don't have alot of negative things to say about Dana. The service was great, the view was wonderful and the amenities were lavish. I would recommend this hotel to young couples or hip familes visiting Chicago for leisure",happy
"I treated my husband to a surprise getaway to Seattle to see one of our favorite bands. We stayed overnight at The Edgewater. The moment we drove onto the hotel property, I was impressed. A circular driveway complete with water feature and two-way fireplace greeted us as we stepped into the rustic, lodge-like lobby. We felt as if we were far from home (really, only -- miles north of Seattle) because it felt like vacation. The reception desk was timely and courteous in checking in. We found at time of check-in we'd been upgraded from a waterside room to a waterfront room which turned out to be just breathtaking! Views of Elliott Bay on a perfect, sunny day greeted us as soon as we entered our room. Our room was spacious, our bed perfectly comfortable, and the bathroom beautiful with its slate shower and flooring. Perfect, relaxing and beautiful night away. We had reservations at the restaurant, Six Seven....the food was divine! The wait staff impeccable and professional, yet friendly. The concierge was most helpful in ordering us a taxi downtown. The next morning, we ordered breakfast in our room and were again blown away by the quality of food....we're still talking of it a day later! Overall, The Edgewater is a place we will return to and recommend to our friends and family.",happy
"i must admit I was looking forward to staying at the hotel after reading the reviews and awards.
I just am going to say that this place is not my cup of tea.
If this is the type of etablishment that wins awards these days, then Trip Advisor has a problem.
It was just mediocre- people were nice, breakfast was okay, etc., but nothing to write home about.
The trip started pretty badly as I had Casa arrange an airport pickup. The driver was tremendously unprofessional (a very fat, dirty and smelly version of Danny DeVito) and the car smelled like someone had slept in it for three days.
I complained to the Casa- and they were very understanding and would look into it.
However, if this boutique is all that it is said to be via comments, I would think that they use a first-rate car service.
In any event, it was probably my mistake as I should have used Select Seven or some other service that I knew would be good.
In all, not worth making the effort to come here. It is clean and well-kept, but I could stay at another comparable HOTEL (not a boutique) per night and probably get better service.
This is more for people that don't come to NYC that often and think that it is a city filled with ingrates and people who would soon rather kick you in the teeth than open a door for you.
For those people, just a word of advice: There are a lot of nicer hotels- with people just as nice as Casa. I smell: A TOURIST TRAP here.",not happy

It was for online booking and had to be paid upfront...at this price, it couldn't be beat. Restaurants and shopping within minutes.

The ---floor hotel also provides a good view of the city from the terrace. The rooms are small, but clean and well appointed and there are room delivery options from nearby restaurants.

"Although much of the vintage charm of the York Hotel is gone, the new Hotel Vertigo is really a treat. The bed and sheets are very comfortable, the bathroom spotlessly clean with mod sink and shower (and H-- toiletries), and the extra touches like the signature lamps and mirror are very cool. And the rates are very affordable. (We got a Renovated Queen for $--.) 
A couple of drawbacks were the fact that the heating system hasn't been upgraded with the rest of the hotel (yet) and was quite loud. Parking is less than ideal, but really no different than the rest of the city. 
Depending on your preferences, the renovation is either a bonus or a letdown. If you're looking for a cool boutique hotel, you'll love it. But if you're hoping to re-create a shot-for-shot scene from the Hitchcock classic, you're out of luck.",happy
"No question, it's a beautiful hotel in a great location, but for what you pay, you'd expect service to be top-notch... Not the case here.

"Living near LA, my family and I were originally planning to visit friends in San Diego on Saturday for a day at the beach and drive back that night. My wife suggested we make a weekend out of it. I started to look into hotels, but San Diego hotels are so overpriced on Saturday nights. We went on Priceline.com and put in a bid for $--. We were surprised when our bid was accepted. Even more suprised to find out the hotel we got was a Hilton Doubletree- and to book the same room at Hilton's website was $---! So we really lucked out. Location of the hotel is near Del Mar off the - Fwy. It's more in a business area than a tourist area. We were able to check in early. Nothing spectacular about our room- average size with - queen beds and view of the parking lot. But at least it was clean and the beds were comphy! For $-- on a summer Saturday night in San Diego- we can't complain. We ended up us getting free breakfast buffets for the next morning, and enjoyed their very nice pool. We would stay here again! So definetely try Priceline and you might get a good rate here.",happy

"This is a nice hotel, with decent rooms, an outstanding entrance, and a good location. Regarding the hotel, there isn't much that can be improved on for the value and is worth the money.

The waiter at Garrity's was simply assuming I wouldn't actually look at the bill. The breakfast buffet at The Cafe is $--.

"It is clear the PUBLIC Chicago's strongest attribute is the excellent customer service. We had nothing but a pleasurable experience with the staff. The common areas and Pump Room are just what you'd expect from a Schrager hotel - very hip and modern. I suppose all of this would make up for the lackluster guest rooms. They are minimalist to the point of being cheap. Speaking of cheap, we booked our room on Priceline for just $--. Bargain price for a Chicago hotel room!",not happy

A lovely hotel with lots of history. A little out of town but easily accessble via metro close to the sights. Room was little sparse but perfectly clean and a very good size.

"We stayed at the JW Marriott as a family a weekend in August. We rented a suite with two ajoining rooms. The suite was huge and spacious, nicely appointed, very clean. The couple of small issues were a lack of drawer space. Travelling with - kids, we really like to unpack and feel organized and there simply was very little drawer space to do this, so we lived out of suit cases. There was plenty of room in the suite for a dresser, but it simply wasn't there. Also, the bathrooms were somewhat lacking for a high end hotel. There is not a lot of counter space and not a seperate room for the toliet. Also, the walls are very thin and I woke up both mornings becasue of people talking outside of my room-it seemed like they were right in our room with us.
Overall, it is a very nice hotel-however, be expecting big and crowded. We had just come from a four seasons in jackson hole, so it took some getting used to.
We were trapped on the runway at the airport because of a bomb threat at the airport. We finally got to the hotel after a long day of travel and the front desk told us that the restaurant at the pool-water park closed at - (it was about -:--) 
We rushed to the pools so the kids could go on the water slides and we could order food-unfortunately, the food service ended at -...so we were out of luck--we were starving and now wet...so we walked to the sports bar-where they told us it would be -- min wait for a table (even though there were a lot of tables open...) so I grabbed the manager, Chelsea, told her our story and she was very helpful and we were seated within minutes. I really appreciated her kindness and attention. Thank you Chelsea for really coming to our rescue! The food was good, service a little slow, but decent.
Prior to our stay-I had called the concierge and asked for recommendations on how to plan our few days at the hotel. She recommended staying on site on saturday because of all the kids activities and heading to Seaworld on Friday.
When we were at the pool on thursday-we asked about booking a cabana for saturday, only to find out they were all booked. This was very frustrating to me for a few reasons-first, in my opinion, if you call and ask for the concierge's advice and they suggest staying on site for a saturday-they should mention the cabana rental. The place was an absolute zoo on saturday. By --am, there were absolutely no chairs left--NONE! line of at least --- guests waiting to get their wrist band to get into the water park. secondly, we were staying in the highest room category on site. At most high end hotels, the guests staying in the highest end rooms are at least offered the ammenties such as a cabana (not for free, just the ability to rent one)...
Thankfully, the concierge manager Donna was wonderful and was able to reserve an end-cap cabana for us and it saved our last day on our vacation. Without that, between the crowds and the heat, it literally would have been miserable. Thank you Donna for your help and understanding.
Honestly, I felt like I was given bad advice by the concierge. The hotel is way over-crowded on the weekend. It is unmanageable and unpleasant. I wish we had gone to seaworld on saturday and stayed at the hotel on fri.
In general, this is a nice, clean hotel. It is just too big for my taste. The crowds were like a vegas hotel. The service was just ok because of the size. We ordered room service every morning and every morning, something was not right.
The water park is great, my kids love waterparks and the slides are big and fun. 
If I were to go back to this hotel, it would certainly not be on a weekend. I wouldn't even consider going on a weekend. Maybe it was because it was the summer...but just crazy.
Also, every time we called the front desk for something, we were on hold for a few minutes.
In short, nice grounds, pretty hotel, clean and big rooms-new, service couldn't keep up with the crowds.
Chelsea and Donna were life savers. They were a highlight of great service during a stay full of very mediocre service.
Lacking the service for a -+ star hotel....but then again, I had just checked out of a Four Seasons, so it had a lot to live up to. You will feel like a number at this hotel-nothing personalize at all.",happy

The lobby was open and airy with a lounge vibe and plenty of people enjoying it. Plus the hotel is only a few blocks walk from the Times Square lights, entertainment & shopping. The only con was that the bathroom fan wasn't working but that was definitely minor. Kudos to TRYP hotel, can't wait to go back!",happy
"The property itself is clean, well-presented and well-maintained. However, for an airport hotel, and a property which does a great deal
of it's business with flight crews, it certainly does not go out of it's way to ensure that the crews are indulged. 
We are Marriott Rewards customers (albeit the basic level), and were assigned a room on the ground floor - with a very narrow door, making
it hard to push our luggage through. This was almost laughable since the rooms on the opposite side of the hall had standard sized doors. 
As other reviewers have noted, internet access is charged at $--.-- plus tax per day ... and parking is $--! So, a relatively inexpensive
room rate is pushed up substantially by the add-ons. So, if you have no car, and no need to use the internet - then this hotel is a relative bargain; if you need those accoutrement then the price rises
rapidly - and I would recommend the Doubletree down off of Sepulveda.
The other matter I took issue with during my stay was the large gathering that was held the morning of our departure. Since we were on the ground floor, and since there was an entry-exit at the end of our hall, it became very noisy in the morning as the group filed in, and furthermore, many members of that group were smokers so the hall was quite malodorous by the time we departed. Apparently, no effort was made to prevent the attendees from smoking in the lodging hallways.
On the bright side, corporate policy allows for a - PM departure upon
request - although that is done via the internet before one's arrival.
In summary, I would like to compliment the staff - to a person, they were pleasant and affable. To the management - rather than nickel-and-diming your flight crews, why not bundle everything so they will want to visit your property when traveling on leisure? 
In all honesty, I probably would not return. More because I was disenchanted with the ground level room and the noise than for any other reason. Otherwise, it has the feel of a mid-level airport hotel.",not happy
"Stayed for several days for business. Very clean, very quiet in the rooms. Free breakfast was ok, about what I would expect. Location is very convenient - restaurants and stores all within walking distance.
Cabs can be hard to get here though - best to have the front desk call in advance. Also, the position of my room was on an inside corner, so if you went up to the window you could look right into your neighbors room, which was a little strange. 
Overall though, I would return.",happy
My husband and I stayed in a guest room with a queen bed. It’s a very historic hotel with people form Teddy Roosevelt to the Beatles staying here.

And true, the location was great - we walked everywhere (Central Park, Chrysler Building, Broadway, etc). The room was indeed newly renovated, but some of it felt like surface make-up. Bits of paint appeared slapped on and was starting to peel off, covering the carpet in small white dots of paint. There was a bit of chewing gum stuck on our bathroom door. The toiletries were nice but not replaced on our second day.There were small hairs stuck to our bathroom door and wall which never got removed. The desk lamp cable was disconnected with no outlet in sight (I found some in the bathroom), the desk drawer was broken and my bed wasn't made properly.
The room temperature showed -- degrees and I admit I'm no genius with thermostats but I usually make them work eventually. Here, I only managed to get cold air and decided to live with it the first night but in the morning my mum had placed a towel over her duvet as she was cold (there was a small draught coming in from the window and no extra rugs or duvet). I called reception and was told that maybe it wasn't cold enough to put on the heat but he would send someone up in a minute or two. We waited -- minutes in vain and left to get breakfast. If the tech person showed up, (s)he did so while we were away. 
I don't know what to make of this hotel. I might stay there again as everything else in the area is so expensive and I can live with little faults - I am after all not in NY to sit all day in my room and I am sure there's far worse out there - but it irks me that the cleaning is not quite up to scratch.",not happy
"My complaints as will be stated below need to be taken in perspective that in the big picture this is a very nice hotel and the location could not be better. The service was top notch.
With that being said, the hotel tries way, way, way too hard to be trendy. Currently, I am -- years old, married with two small children and have no party in me. I am hardly a stick-in-the-mud, but I'm almost always in bed by -- pm.
This hotel tries so hard to be trendy that it is almost uncomfortable. The rooms are some of the smallest I have ever been in. The bed was a single queen and I'm used to a king. I guess I was too cheap to upgrade to a king. Not used to having to do that. The mattress and bedding were truly heavenly.
The glass enclosed shower leaked out the bottom and made the tiny """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""bathroom area"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" very, very slick. I imagine that there must be some horrific falls in that hotel.
On the top of the hotel is an over the top trendy bar and night club that pretends to be super exclusive. Frankly, a lot of the women going in and out of there looked like working girls if you know what I mean. The seating was poor and the menu was sparse (also I'm a vegan and can usually make any menu work, but there was nothing I could do with this one).
We used a female concierge who was fabulous. The wifi in the room was $-- a day per device. Somehow, even though we were on the -th floor (out of --) with a window, my att LTE -g got no service. . . . . . the free wifi in the lobby was great.
Again, in the big picture this stuff is pretty nitpicky. It is a very nice hotel, great location and we enjoyed our stay.",happy
"Just got home from San Francisco and I stayed for - nights. My room was on the --th floor and had great views over Union Square. I have no complaints at all about my stay, I was greeted nicely and friendly when I checked in, the concierge was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Here are a few tips for a great stay at the St. Francis. Dont pay for the cheapest room, its a -* hotel so naturally if you pay for the cheapest room it will be the smallest and have a poor view, so if you can afford to stay here, make sure you pay a bit extra. There are lots of categories of rooms and two wings to stay in so do a bit of research before booking. Dont not stay here because of the people who complain about the price of food etc, of course its expensive, its a -* hotel, but when in San Francisco why eat-drink away your money in the hotel? There are many great places a few mins walk out the door that offer just as good food for half the price. When I asked the concierge for recommendations on where to eat, he never mentioned their own restaurants which goes to show they do care about your experience in the city as a whole, not just how much you spend at the hotel. There are a lot of reviews that complain about how busy it is, that is never a bad thing. Its busy for a reason, its a great place to stay, its a city and national landmark building and has dozens of meeting-conference rooms which are always in use. Anyway, I just think this is a really great hotel and would recommend to anyone.",happy
"i loved the hotel. receptionists were really nice. the bed very comfortable, big tv and free wifi.
the free coffee and tea are great. and its location is amazing, i was able to walk to nearly all my destinations.
i chose - instead of - because the room service took ages to come, so by the time im back to the hotel room for rest in mid day, she'd knock on my door and start working while im there. also the ac at my room kept changing temperature by itself, so id end up freezing while sleeping. and there was some tiny little problems that are not worth mentioning. 
overall, when i'm back to Chicago, ill surely book there again :)",happy

"My husband and I have just returned from a short break at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel. 
I must say that after reading the mixed reviews on this site, I was apprehensive about stopping here. However, we were very pleasantly surprised. 
The plus sides of the hotel were: 
- the main areas of the hotel are beautifully decorated; very ornate 
- price; very good value
- location; it's very central and close to brilliant shops - restaurants - Boston Common - Cheers, etc
- our room was comfortable (the bed was great) and large (room ----) 
- MJ O'Connors Irish Bar; well, we were there over Paddy's Day! 
The downsides to the hotel were: 
- it's very busy (it appears to host lots of conferences); check-in took a whole and the general phone numbers weren't answered quickly
- it was noisy first thing in the morning; we were at the back of the hotel right above the loading bays 
- the staff weren't particularly friendly 
- they didn't have a UK - US adapter (despite telling us that they had), and we were unable to locate one in town. Lesson learnt - if you're planning to use UK electrical equipment, don't forget to bring an adapter with you!",not happy
"Really friendly and welcoming staff who could not do enough to help! great pool, clean hotel. Rooms are beautiful big suites. Great little treats available -- hours, we even got given ice lollies when we were in the pool! 
Also in great location, just a block away from Hollywood boulevard, and easy access for visiting Universal Studios as the metro nearby.",happy
"We stayed for three days and then another stay of one day. The shuttle was great and took us to another hotel to meet our coach tour. We stored luggage whilst we were on the coach tour. The room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was ok, the pool was heated and the staff were very professional. I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for clean reasonably priced accommodation close to LAX. We booked through the Travelodge Website prior to leaving Australia and everything worked really well.",not happy
"Ive stayed at the Liberty several times and each time is better than the next. They greet you with a complimentary glass of champagne,yes please, they already make you feel like a VIP! The staff is so nice and pleasant,they are very accommodating with all requests! The hotel is somewhat new and very modern. The restaurants are also very good, Clink is exceptional and Alibi is a great bar to just grab a drink or two. Even the lobby itself is great to grab a drink and they also have a special bar for hotel guests only,this is ALWAYS one of my first reccomendations of where to stay in Boston and usually mine when I want a staycation or for a fun event!",happy
"After the hotel that I was staying at closed last minute due to an emergency (received a call the night before), I was in a panic to find - rooms for my family. After calling around to quite a few hotels, the Crowne Plaza offered to reserve the - rooms at the same rate as my previous hotel. After reading reviews on trip advisor, and being extremely particular, I almost considered cancelling & finding something else. I am so glad I didn't. The hotel is beautiful. The staff is extremely friendly & accommodating. They gave us a river view, which was beautiful. Yes, you can hear noise from the bar if you are in those room categories, so, if you're a light sleeper (which I am not), I would ask for a quieter room. That did not bother us at all. No it's not a brand new hotel, not every hotel can be. But I thought it was very nice, and I would not hesitate to stay here again, and you shouldn't either!",happy

"Having recently recovered from breast cancer treatment I was looking forward to my roadtrip from Mobile Alabama to Redding CT. I picked up my best friend, Sue, in Baltimore and we drove from there to NYC...and the BEAUTIFUL Blue Moon hotel. The hotel has been exquisitely and lovingly renovated by the hotel's owner, Randy. Sue and I both were very impressed with the pure cleanliness of the huge room and luxurious bath. We were in the Sophie Tucker room (all rooms are named after ----s & --s vaudeville stars) and it was perfect for two friends. The daybed was much more comfortable than a pull out sofa and with its high back and ends Sue and I both felt like we had our own space and privacy when it was time to go to bed.
The people who work at the Blue Moon were wonderfully sweet and helpful. In fact, it was my initial phone conversation with (manager?) Antonella, that got me exctied about the hotel and made my decision to stay two nights insted of just one. I am so glad I did. Thank you, Antonella (or Roma as I called you!)
Stay at the Blue Moon next time you're in NYC - you won't be sorry!!",happy
"I have the opportunity to visit downtown Chicago often for business, and have stayed at a good variety of nice spots downtown (e.g., Conrad, Palomar, James, The Blackstone, Omni, etc...). Dana Hotel rates at or above any of the experiences I've had staying downtown.
I arrived late on a Monday evening. The front desk team was friendly and helpful. In room dining from Argent restaurant downstairs was very prompt, and the food was excellent. My room was up-to-date, clean and spacious, with an awesome view of State Street.
Next time I'm in Chicago, I will definitely check availability at Dana Hotel first.",happy
"We stayed here two weeks ago for a week during the high school speech and debate tournament. Throughout the week there were lots of issues--the first issue was that we were not able to check in until - p.m. From - pm on they kept telling us our room ws being worked on and would be ready in -- min. At six I finally asked why they kept saying -- more minutes and they told me that was all their computer would let them say--two options---- more min or not ready at all. In addition, the woman on the phone was crazy rude about it """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""You people have been calling me all day!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is what she said. I did not raise my voice, was not short with her, but was blown away by the rudeness. Finally, we did get our room and credit for $-- for the inconvenience.
The next issue we had was trying to make phone calls using the business center. The woman working there was taking a personal call and loudly announced, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""people here so I'm probably going to be here awhile!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" There were three of us trying to make some emergency phone calls and use internet on our phones and the woman walked over and turned the television on to so you think you can dance so loud that I could not hear the person on the phone. Clearly, she did not want us in the business center. 
Sheets on the bed were musty smelling and housekeeping was marginal. 
Let me also say very clearly that last week I did email and spoke with mgmt and they apologized and said it had been a rough week for them. They sent me a voucher for a free room. I feel like they were trying hard and being more than fair, I'm just not sure I would ever stay here again.",not happy
"While a bit dated, the Westin Philadelphia is a beautiful hotel, with dark wood paneling and chandeliers throughout. However, the staff does not like their chosen line of work that much. I had to harass the concierge for a small request (to find a jazz club for that night). The room was not particularly clean either (spots on the carpet, etc.) During my next stay in Philadelphia, I think I'll try the Sofitel. My wife and I wandered in for breakfast and it looked much more promising.",not happy
"Just arrived back in the UK after a - night stay at the On The Ave Hotel. Booked a double double room through Expedia, got an upgrade to a Queen Queen on arrival as we were there to get married. Room was on -th floor, big and spacious with two kingsize beds. Modern furnishings and style, very comfortable. Huge bathroom with big walk in shower all kitted out in black marble, complete with small plasma TV.
Staff were very welcoming, doormen were always ready to help and often a step ahed of the guest (eg ready with a complementary umbrella when it was raining). In fact, when we arrived, the toilet overflowed and there was a maintenance man there within - minutes, who fixed the problem and cleaned up the water. It happened so efficiently that it doesn't even register as a prblem in the memory bank.
Coffee perculator in the room was very welcome - NB creamer and sugar IS supplied (contrary to what another reviewer says) it's all in the gold packet with the coffee sachet! Chocs on turn-down were lovely (plus the next day's weather forecast)
My only gripe would be that the wardrobe (closet) is way too small - well not so much the closet space itself, but the area within it given over to hanging space. Just about enough for - person if that, but lots of drawer space.
Yes, it would have been nice to have a bar in the hotel, but there is no need for a breakfast room when the Manhattan Diner is about -- steps away and open --hours (breakfasts are huge, tasty and very reasonable - never more than $-- for two people and that was the day we had smoked salmon!)
The area is great - loads of restaurants and shops on Broadway and Amsterdam. Fab delis in the area (Westend Market and Zabars). Great pubs-bars up the road on Amsterdam (Dead Poet and George Keeleys are recommended).
Subway was either at --th street (less than - mins walk) or --nd Street - about -- mins away. Neighbourhood felt very safe, even walking around past midnight. Loads of cabs on Broadway or Amsterdam Ave.
- blocks to museums and central park, half hour stroll to Columbus Circle.
Really, what more could you ask for in NY? On the Ave was a great hotel in a great neighbourhood, with access to excellent amenities and within easy reach of the hustle and bustle of downtown.
I'd stay there again, no hesitation.",happy

"Never having been to Detroit or Michigan, my boyfriend and I decided to book one night at he beautifully restored Westin Book Cadillac before heading to Ann Arbor for a wedding. It's an easy -- min drive from the airport if you're renting a car and we had no trouble locating it.
Please be aware parking is NOT free or included. $-- to park for --hrs in the attached garage and $-- for valet. 
Pros-
-. Good location.
-. Good restaurants. --grille was superb.
-. Great front desk service (as expected from Westin).
-. Nicely appointed room & bath.
-. Ok gym and small indoor pool.
-. Nice, albeit expensive, spa services.
-. Friendly hotel bar-good drinks.
Cons-
-. Cost of parking.. On the day of our departure I called the front desk inquiring about the valet service and if we would be charged for another full day if we went to lunch before requesting our car. They assured us this would be no problem, but low and behold my c-c is showing $--. That means we paid an extra $-- for - hr and would have taken our car out sooner if we had know. Really disappointed and hoping to resolve this with the hotel.
-. The hostess at Roast was pretty rude-disinterested. We are from NYC and used to having to wait for a table. She quoted us -.- hrs without even looking up from her station. She then recommended (again without looking up) that we sit at the bar, so I walked around the corner and mentioned it was full which she basically repeated back to me. It really turned us off to even eating there, for one of the highest recommended restaurants in Detroit one would expect great service and a friendly atmosphere... Alas.
-. No free wifi or Internet. Seriously?
Otherwise we had a great trip and would potentially consider staying here again now that we realize some of the added costs (and they add up fast).",happy

Stayed here for the night with my fiance. When he went to check in he was told that we were given a complimentary upgrade to the penthouse floor at no cost to us. Friendly and accommodating.

"We stayed at the Hotel Commonwealth on two occassions during our recent travels around New England. The Hotel is located in the Back Bay area of Boston some -km from the downtown area of the CBD. This was a good choice as driving in and out of the area is much easier than the downtown area and it is close to the main InterstateTurnpikes and rail stations. The hotel itself is located right above a tube station. It is an esay - min walk to hip Newbury St with all its cafes & restaurants. We upgraded to a deluxe room which was quite large and had all the mod cons etc. Maybe a little pricey, but well worth the extra coin.
The staff were super friendly and helpful and they arranged bookings etc for us. A well recommended place to stay in Boston.",happy

"I read the other reviews by prior visits and was very concerned. So in effect my expectations were lowered a bit. But I was suprised. Yes, when it was built it was a showplace of the period. I loved looking at the architecture as the build had to be difficult. So I saw something different then others. 
The room was comfortable and in good shape, had a water for view and a balcony. Room service was ok. Nothing to write home about but I did not starve either. 
The bath was smaller than some hotels these days but not to small to worry about touching the shower curtain :) I would stay again.",not happy

"These spacious suites will spoil you. Super Clean, Comfortable Bed, Excellent Internet-Desk for working. - TV's great for couples that have different tastes. Staff is very friendly and available. 
We travel crossing the states several times per year. We love this hotel so much, we pick our overnight cities where there are Cambria. Columbus is our Cambria when we travel between Virginia and Wisconsin. 
If there is one near you, do not hesitate to book. You will not be disappointed.",happy
"If you looking for a clean hotel significantly less expensive than most others in downtown Seattle, the Moore is a good choice. We went in late September so the outside air temperature was in the low --'s. We were able to cool our room by opening the window, but this let in considerable traffic noise which doesn't let up all night. Don't know what a person would do if the outside temps were hot. The rooms are quite small and there is only one tiny elevator serving the entire hotel. If your expectations are for a --th century hotel experience, you will be just fine.",not happy
"Stayed at the Sofitel at the end of July for three nights, while on business in Philly. Hotel is very comfortable and, as has been stated within other reviews, the rooms are spacious with great beds! The walk in showers are also a plus. I had an issue on my first night due to a foul smell in the room (drains or air con), when the problem was raised with the front desk they were very apologetic and placed me in a suite on the top floor, so that can't be bad. I booked the hotel on the hotel website and paid for the business premium that included breakfast and other bits and bobs like ironing and free internet, if you wanted it. This worked out to be good value as colleagues paid for room only and with breakfast it worked out more than the business rate 
The restaurant area for breakfast and dinner is very good and the service excellent. The hotel has a gym, which has a number of CV machines and a couple of weight units plus free weights, if required. The gym was well kept and had fruit, water and towels available if required. If you forget the Ipod, there are head sets with disposable """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""foam"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ear pieces, if required. There is music and TV on the machines.
The bar area is comfortable and they do good snack food to consume with the beer, if you are hungry!
The hotel is in a great location for eating, shopping and generally walking around.
Over all, the staff, comfort and environment were very good and I would recommend the hotel to colleagues. I would stay there again, if on business or holiday.",happy
"So many disheartening problems with this hotel that I'll just list them:
-. Our reservation for a queen-bedded room @ $---.-night turned out to be a room without a bath - just a shower. Hotel now wanted $---. for a room with a bathtub. Only king-bedded rooms have bathtubs but hotel does not tell you this unless you ask. It was hard work on our part to convince the hotel to give us a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""bathtubbed room"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for the advertised price of $---. Finally, they gave it to us @ $---. but only for one night of the four nights we'd booked. This king-bedded room was very pretty but its bathtub was a half-bathtub (a.k.a. 'hip bath'). You can only sit upright in it, knees in the air, but you cannot stretch out.
-. On day #-, @$---., we came back at the end of the day to a completely unmade room. The desk guy belligerently barked at me, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I DON""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""T make beds!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" twice, and then """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I don't know HOW to make beds!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""What do you EXPECT me to do?!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" when I told him the problem. We despaired and asked for clean towels. He didn't want to take away the dirty ones and sighed at this. He stomped and pouted in time while emptying the bins. The next morning he told me I was very rude for TELLING him after the housekeeping staff had gone, that we expected our room to be cleaned. Neither he or the management ever said 'Sorry"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".
-. On day #-, we still hadn't been given a single bar of soap. Today there was no Kleenex or toilet paper. We had to go get it ourselves.
-. On day #-, we arrived back at night to discover the toilet had not been cleaned. And it nearly overflowed when we flushed it. I called the desk about this immediately. Back came the emphatically pained response of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Oh nooooo"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". No 'thank you' whatsoever.
The beds are comfortable, the elevator rickety and its whirring sounds audible in nearby rooms. The rooms are peaceful-looking. The decor is more late --'s suburban than art deco; the lobby is more authentic. If it weren't for employees who delight in offering non-service, and housekeeping staff who don't care about their jobs, the place would have been kinda pleasant. The only Philadelphians who weren't nice seemed to all have jobs at this hotel!
On check-out, the manager gave us one free night in compensation for poor service. But I'm still wondering, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Why does this hotel in Philadelphia cost $--.-night more than our room in a --th. century townhouse in the Marais in Paris with a balcony, authentic furnishings, French-milled soaps, chandelier, and impeccable service, even free umbrellas for sudden rainfall?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Next time in Philly, I will curb my expectation of style, my penchant for independent hotels. I'll book the Holiday Express on Walnut Street instead.",not happy

"This newer hotel met the standards expected of a Pan Pacific. We stayed here for three weekend nights at a rate of $--- found on Orbitz. The hotel is located just north of downtown and on the edge of the South Lake Union neighborhood. There is a Whole Foods in the building and a spa-health club across the driveway circle.
Our room was average sized but had new furnishings, quality bathroom fixtures and a comfortable bed (however I prefer the new beds found at Marriott and Westin). There was a large flat screen television and floor to ceiling windows (we had close up views of the condos across the driveway so you need to close the blinds for privacy).
The staff was very friendly even though we had no special requests. There is free internet access in the lobby and a bar which we did not take advantage of on this trip. There is street parking in the neighborhood, which was practical for us but may be a hassle if you are planning on leaving the car for extended periods as the spots are metered. The health club across the way was of decent size and there was no charge which was a pleasant surprise.
The main drawback from our perspective was the bathroom, which had a sliding wooden door that faced the living room (you can watch tv from the tub if you wish) -- doesn't allow for that much privacy if you are traveling with a companion.",happy
"This was my second stay, so I feel I can justify my comments. This hotel is not the St. Regis but doesn't represent itself to be such. If that is what you want, pay the price and go there. This is a tremendous value and is in a great location -- very close walk to Times Square, Port Authority, a zillion restaurants, theaters, and many other West Side draws, yet is in a very quiet location and not in the middle of the noise and chaos of Times Square. The gentleman at the front desk was extremely helpful. The rooms on both occasions were spotlessly clean and surprisingly ample in size, NOT the size of a small closet like the W New York on Lexington. The fact that it is located right next to the Parole Office just adds to the NY atmosphere and I have NEVER felt unsafe.",happy
"At first I was unsure about the hotel because I saw it was right by the freeway. However the drive way was further back from the freeway, so it helped with the noise of traffic. It was only a minute away from old town, easy to access sea world and everything else you needed. 
The breakfast in the morning was amazing, really good food. There is also a big swim area and a small fitness center and game room. Really clean, spacious rooms, with full kitchen and office desk area. I never heard noise from other guests nearby. 
I will stay there again sometime in the future, maybe during the week to save money!!",happy
"I stayed here for one night, because I had a job interview the next morning and I wanted to be within walking distance. My room was on the ground floor at the end of a hallway directly adjacent to a big construction site. There were literally construction materials a foot away from the door to my room, and the whole area was dusty and gross.
The room itself was smallish, dark, and in bad need of renovation. It was a smoking room - so there was a strong perfume smell that they had apparently added to mask the smell (frankly, stale cigarette smoke would have been more pleasant).
The best part of this hotel is its location, you are steps away from Little Italy which has a string of nice restaurants, and you can easily walk anywhere downtown. The airport is also just a short ----- min drive away.
In summary, I would only stay here if you wanted to be downtown, and were looking for a totally no-frills room.",not happy

"Having stayed at other Four Seasons Hotels I especially chose to stay here in Boston. I was not disappointed. The hotel is very modern, yet outrageously opulent. Marble floors and high ceilings in the foyer set the seal for a wonderfully luxurious stay.
The health - spa - swimming pool is on the roof top, though enclosed by a beautiful grass roof.There are many spa treatments on offer, though a bit pricey.
Though we had a standard room it was beautiful; spacious, beautifully appointed, with L'Occitaine products in the bathroom, ( regularly topped up and replaced ).
Every member of staff, even the domestic staff, was charming and went out of their way to help.

Expensive? yes but worth every penny.
The hotel is in a great situation within easy walking distance of all the parts of Boston you would want to see. It is easy to find and sits comfortably on the side of Boston Common, (Boston's """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Central Park'')on the opposite side to Old Boston and the Cheers bar.
The hop-on hop-off tour bus stops just outside, so there is no need for a car or taxis. Having said that Boston is a very easy city to drive around.
If you are flying to Boston Airport it is only -- minutes by car from the airport to the hotel.",happy
"I stayed at the Windsor Park not knowing what to expect since it was not a known chain hotel. It turned out great the room was standard size with refridgerator, hair dryer, and iron. The staff was friendly and very knowledgable about the city and how to get around. It's surrounded by buetiful embassys and fancy D.C. homes, and they offer a free breakfast and free wi fi internet. I will stay here every time i'm in Washington and send my friends and family.",happy
"A colleague and I flew into Dallas to meet with some vendors and came across this hotel through Starwood. It is unlike any Starwood I have stayed at and we were delighted to have a boutique experience with the perks of a Starwood hotel. 
The rooms were pretty tight, but were definitely comfy and unique. (I felt a little like I was on a cruise ship.) Very modern and fun place, loved all the amenities and decor. 
Swam at the pool on the roof one day and had breakfast in the restaurant. Everything was great.",happy
"We loved the Magic Castle! 
Our family of four (- kids, - and -) stayed in a - bedroom apartment which was huge. The hotel is an old apartment block and so the - bedrooms, lounge, kitchen and bathroom were so spacious and had everything we needed. The beds were the most comfy we had on our trip to California. The shower could've been more vigorous but that's the only bad thing I can think of!
But as others have said, the real bonus of staying here is the staff - they were all so friendly and helpful, dishing out free snacks and ice lollies by the pool. The free breakfast was good - pastries, toast, fruit, yoghurt and cereal.
The location was excellent - even my 'walk shy' children were happy to walk to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the various restaurants in the vicinity.
Overall I would not hesitate in recommending The Magic Castle to anyone who wants space, in a great location, with amazing staff who will look after you.",happy
"The room is your average hotel room, nothing noteworthy, but nothing really terrible. There was a little mold in the corners of the shower, but not excessive. Although for a -.- star hotel I would expect better.
The bed was comfortable and noise was not a problem, the disappointing part is how they nickle and dime you. Paying for parking is to be expected, but when asked are there any cheaper lots around they failed to mention the one just across the street. My booking was supposed to be a guaranteed king room, but they told me if I wanted to upgrade my two double beds to a single king I would have to pay $-- extra. It's like that for everything. Anything you want you pay. Internet access you pay. This is the first hotel where I've stayed at as a guest that I've had to pay.",not happy
"I have to admit, their front desk staff are probably the NICEST and most helpful front desk staff I've ever encountered at any hotel I've stayed at including - star hotels. The hotel lobby and the rooms are very cozy, and the bathroom was updated with great lighting. I had a very comfortable stay here and slept very well (no noise from other rooms nor street noise - except for the Friday morning garbage truck picking up garbage at -am - ugh, that was a bit noisy). The hotel is in a great location too - you can walk to many restaurants, bars and shopping district, and the Westfield mall is just a quick -- min drive away on local streets with See's Candies just a quick -- min drive (on the way to the mall). Overall great stay, and I will be stay here again the next time I am in town for business.",happy
I travel to Indianapolis for business often and this is one of my favorite places to stay. Very clean rooms and good service. Sleek and trendy style. Great view of the river and park. Hotel is by museums and parks. Convenient in and out parking which is not as pricey as other downtown hotels. People have made complaints about parking costs but downtown Indianapolis is expensive. The free breakfast is a bonus which makes this hotel a good value.,happy
"I've stayed at this hotel a couple of times. It has a good location, being just off the main street in downtown area and only about -- minutes walk along a well-lit, pedestrianised street to Beale Street area. It is a nice location, as one side of the hotel is the parking lot, and the other side opens out onto the main street where the trolley cars pass, and you can sit outside and watch the world go by.
Rooms are acceptable but not that big - a bit small if you're staying for more than a night I'd think. Staff were mixed - the person who checked me in was very 'cold' and unwelcoming, but another member of staff later on was very welcoming and addressed me by name each time we passed in the hotel.
Continental breakfast was OK - bagels, toast, yoghurts, pastries and a do-it-yourself waffle maker, but the lady on breakfast service was quite grumpy and unhelpful. If the breakfast was meant to run until -am, at -.--am when things were starting to run out, she refused to replenish anything - even when it was obvious that there was plenty more. I felt sorry for the people who came down after me as they would have gone hungry!!
Overall, ----. At least it was clean!",happy
"We stayed at the Radisson for - nights on recommendation from my Brother who had previously stayed there. We found the Staff most helpful on checking in . Our room was very spacious and the beds were very very comfortable,we didn't have to ask for a fridge there was already one there. There was a coffee making machine in the room but I had taken my own travel kettle as we were moving on from here to Las Vegas and knew they wouldn't provide anything there. The room was a tad noisy in the day as we were on the front-but everything shuts down outside about --pm so not a problem. We ate at Johnny Rockets most mornings and were quite satisfied. We did find S. Francisco more expensive than we had bargained for but there is a mixed price package of restaurants down on the Wharf. There is a facility in Reception for you to check in for on-going flights and print off boarding passes at no extra cost. Whilst we were there we went on a one day trip to Yosemite National Park with Incredible Adventures which we booked on the internet before we travelled .This Hotel is also convenient for Pier -- and trips to Alcatraz.. Yes this Hotel could do with a bit of a re-furb but we found it on the whole very comfortable and convenient. Perhaps you should consider the Sheraton if you want more style it sits right behind the Radisson.",happy
"Stayed here during our Honeymoon tour of the west coast last year and would strongly recommend it.
Warm friendly welcome, fantastic location right on the beach and just a few minutes walk from the main sight of Venice. 
Rooms are very clean and comfortable and finished to a high standard, a little small but more than big enough for the amount of time we spent in them.
If I was in LA again would deffinately choose to stay here.",happy
"A lovely hotel in a great location. I fell in love with the shower -- super-hot water and powerful shower head made me feel like I'd had a spa treatment every time I took a shower! The hotel was really pretty quiet, too.
I didn't much care for the continental breakfast, as the pickings were slim and some of the pastries seemed stale. But if they could just make that one little improvement, I'd call this hotel perfect.",happy
"This was my first stay at a Club Quarters. And frankly I was surprised. Surprised in the most pleasant of ways.
The location was not a surprise as I had seen it when I booked. But it is marvellous. Wacker and Michigan Avenue. When I walked out the door I was greeted with the iconic Chicago skyline, now including the reflective glass of the Trump Tower.
Nor was I surprised that the room was small, as that was mentioned on Trip Advisor. But the room must have been designed by the same people who do cruise ships, in that everything was right where it should be. And there was plenty of room for all my clothing with a adequate closet and large drawers. The desk was ample and included lots of power points and an additional pull out desk area. A swivel light was perfectly placed. The bathroom was modern with a great shower. The flat screen TV was placed just right for comfortable viewing from my bed.
I was surprised with the following.
Surprise -: Free, acceptably fast wireless internet access in my room. 
Surprise -: Printing from my desk to a machine in their business centre. No charge for the printing.
Surprise -: A filtered water station just a few steps from my room. I just filled a bottle (provided at the station) with chilled water and took it to my room. Wonderful.
Surprise -: I collected as many -- cent pieces as I could find for the laundry, and took my clothes to be laundered. There I discovered that the machines did not accept 'quarters'. They didn't take any payment. The laundry, including washing powder and dryer fabric softener was provided at no extra charge. 
The staff were all friendly, helpful and efficient. So, as you can probably guess, it will be no surprise to see me stay at this hotel again.",happy
so nice to be able to walk to an entire retail center of great restaurants and shops. New hotel features the new courtyard concept. Very small gym was only negative. great lobby for business discussions. about a -- minute drive from airport.,happy
"My husband and I needed a quick overnight in the city to refresh. We stayed at Le Meridien for the first time and liked it a lot. The location is great for walking around Rittenhouse and Center City and the hotel is modern and personal. The contrast between the beautiful old building and sleek furnishings was just our style. The lobby bar was a perfect place for a nightcap and we had a really delicious breakfast the next morning in Amuse. All in all, just the fix we needed.",happy
"I stayed at the Back Bay Hotel last week with my husband and - daughters, -- and --. I loved the idea that it was the old Police headquarters. It is beautifully decorated with top notch customer service, super comfy beds and in a great location.",happy
"We’ve stayed here twice now; once for - days and this past time for - night. We were given a room on the ground floor just a few doors down from the lobby. The place was noisy. The AC unit ran real loud. It came on as needed and woke me up whenever it started to work so I was forced to leave the loud fan on all night for background noise. On the plus side it blocked the noise of people in the parking lot, but I slept really poorly. The room itself was large and furnished well enough. The staff was friendly. We did not eat breakfast this time, but based on previous visits it was the perfectly acceptable breakfast included at this hotel chain. It is nice that you can get coffee and tea often throughout the entire day. It’s not really in the small heart of downtown, but a - min walk gets you to the Arizona Center mall and then another -- min to the ball park. I might stay here again as I get Holiday points (disclaimer this was a free room purchased with points), but I will ask for an upper floor.",not happy
"We had a wonderful stay here for - nights. Fantastic view of Time Square. Our greeting was warm and friendly. The light breakfast included was a bonus. We had a suite and the room was huge and also very clean. The hotel is close to everything - Rockafella Centre, -th Avenue and you are right on Time square. We have stayed in New York before at other hotels but will this will be the one we will definately stay at from now on.",happy
"I have just spent an extended five nights at the city club new york due to the so called hurricane Irene... 
This hotel is a real gem close to all the action at times square... the staff are exceptional from the people who service the rooms to the manager Hugo, 
The front desk people always great you with a smile which seems to be hard to find in the big apple... 
I found The rooms where very comfortable for New york standards with a very trendy decor....
If you book in at the City Club you will not be dissapointed",happy
"It's a great location and the hotel has some charm to it. But far too many years have passed since this hotel got a thorough face lift. The public areas are battered, chipped, worn and have that deeply ingrained dirt that even deep cleaning can't remove. Many rooms are smaller than the prison cell where Vaclev Havel was incarcerated in Prague (it's been turned into a hotel room and I happened to stay there several years ago). New York is expensive, but even the comparatively low prices in this hotel do not compensate for its run down condition.",not happy
"The Chambers is a quiet, modern well-kept hotel in a great location. Their staff was eager to please and while the room was tight, it was more than adequate--stylish, really. For a pleasure trip to Nyc--close to MOMA, Central Park, and shopping --it's a find.",not happy
"Stayed at the Belvedere for - nights in November, - ladies (between the ages of -- and --) and - rooms, we had ample space for - in each room and it never felt too crowded even with all the suitcases and daily purchases we made!! The hotel was clean, warm and comfortable and the staff were all very nice and helpful. We were up early every morning and gone for the full day between sightseeing and shopping we did not have time to sit around the hotel and find fault with so much to see and do in he city!!! We thoroughly enjoyed our experience in the hotel and would defo go back there again. 
It is in a perfect location, a block from times square and within walking distance of Macy, -th Avenue, Rockefellar centre and central park. We walked absolutely everywere but what better way to get the feel of the city!! I would recommend La Pigelle on the corner for breakfast and Hurleys restaurant one block up from the hotel for steaks!!! We also felt extremely safe around the hotel and the city in general. The hotel was just perfect to come back to after a full day of walking, sightseeing and shopping. The room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels placed in the bathroom. 
We also did the hop on hop off tour which we found to be a great help and got us to places we may not have seen otherwise!! It is worth $-- for the -- hour useage. The TOTR was absolutely brilliant and the views were amazing!! I would also recommed using the staten island ferry for a view of the Statue of Liberty, its free and it gives an excellent view. Woodbury Common was also worth the trip out!!! We just loved everything about the city and the hotel was the perfect base for us to come back to!!!
It may have been our first visit to NYC and the Belvedere but it certainly will not be the last!!!",happy
"We booked our tickets to land in NYC and arrive at the hotel such that we could check in at the standard time of - pm. We got there by -:-- and were told that our two rooms were not available for check in and they had no idea of the status. The check in lady was not rude, but gave me a fake sorry and said she couldn't help it - they were just busy. In the meanwhile, my old parents were hungry and tired so we sat them in the lobby and went to get them food. We came back and by -:-- pm, only one of the two rooms had been readied. We finally got the second one around -:-- pm. My beef is with the first check in person who said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""she couldn't help it, they were just busy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". It's just ridiculous that the hotel wouldn't respect paying traveller's time and not have two rooms ready timely. They claimed that both rooms were really """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""nice"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" - but the first one was so typically small that there was no room to walk). The second one was better. 
A different check in person sent up the second room keys with upgraded breakfast coupons (we already had basic breakfast coupons as part of the package), which I appreciate. Unfortunately even the breakfast was so horrible that we refused to eat there every morning. For a Hilton in midtown, I would think they'd get a better chef-cooks and improve their breakfast.
Overall, the hotel is small, in a good location, and has a cute lobby. But their check in procedures and restaurant food (at least for breakfast) need SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT! Oh not to mention the random noises made by the AC unit at night! And the elevators that would keep getting stuck on floor --!
One positive note - their belldesk staff and door men were simply awesome!",not happy
"The pros: best location. Two minutes from metro. Great diverse restaurants everywhere. Safe neighborhood. King standard room was very spacious, clean, and updated. Staff were all friendly and helpful. Room rate was incredible so don't complain about the minimalist free breakfast. If you want more, take the money you saved on the room rate and go outside the hotel.
The cons: parking is expensive at $-- a night plus $- tax, but lots in the area are more for overnight parking.
This was a great value for what I paid.",happy
"l've been staying here for several years and find the location fairly convenient . The rooms are a little small but very comfortable and like the art deco look . l usually always stay at the concierge level and feel pampered with the light fare served during the mornings as well the very helpful people working who've made great suggestions and tips for sightseeing and places the locals know of . Would go back every time if they'll have me and the cost isn't bad either . Restaurant is only fair in my opinion but overlooked by most because of the great options within a few blocks such as Roy's , Matyson , The Capital Grill , Le Bec Fin , Alma De Cuba , The Prime Rib , Morimoto , Morton's , Audrey Claire , Fork and not to mention The Reading Market . Close to most things and directly on a mass transportation route which certainly is convenient .This Hotel also has a nice workout area and lap pool along with a sauna and steam room . l'll be back soon .",happy
"We stayed for - nights this marathon weekend. The lobby is trendy and fun but the buzz stops there. You'll wait for slow elevators ( which we didn't have time for) so we took the stairs. Climbing stairs isn't a problem but if you are there to walk, explore, or run a marathon it's tiresome and annoying. Besides being slow the lift only fit - people max, - comfortably. Also, with regard to space, there was barely room for one shared suitcase. You cannot unpack because there are only shallow desk drawers- no dresser. If you are the kind of person who needs to spread out and organize your stuff, make sure you spring for a large room--and find out what """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""large"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" actually means. Our room couldn't have been larger than --x-- with a full size bed taking up most of the floor space. It is hard to understand how small this is until your find yourself loosing things because piles of paper and bags quickly accumulate with so little storage space. On the up side, it felt safe and reasonably clean. There is a -- hour grocery with healthy food next door and a Starbucks up the street if you need to get some early coffee like we did. I think they should consider removing the Bose Wave Radios and replacing them with little coffee machines. That would be great.",not happy
"This was our second stay at the Holiday Inn Van Nuys. Its well located as a first night stopover hotel if youre arriving in LAX and travelling North the next day - we were going to Mammoth.
The main reasons choosing this property (apart from the Trip Advisor ratings) were distance from LAX (a relatively easy -- min drive after collecting our hire car) and ease of access from the Interstate. It also appears to be a relatively safe neighbourhood (you can make some big mistakes in LA) and theres a Dennys in the adjoining car park.
Our room was an improvement on our last stay and was pleasantly decorated and had two large doubles. 
The breakfast room is pleasant and the choice of items is good - especially the cinammon buns - and sets you up for the day. If you really wanted a full cooked breakfast Dennys is just outside.
Staff were friendly and helpful.
On the down side we weer disturbed by the early emptying of dumpsters in the adjacent restaurants but overall a safe choice for a stopover.",happy
"The hotel was terrible! After waiting for our room for - hours, they proceeded to put us in a room that hadn't even been cleaned (dirty sheets, dirty bathroom, cans and bottles on room - yuck!)
After notifying the front desk, two of my friends went down to check out the next room incase it was worse. The room looked fine - until we noticed a space heater in the corner - the front desk explained it wasn't the hotels (????????) and that some people travel with them ?????? Upon spraying everything down with Lysol - one friend went to use the bathroom. As she was sitting, the toilet spit up a huge """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""geiser"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". I don't know any other way to describe it. This continued our entire trip. The front desk, notrour travel company (A to Z travel out of Ebensburgh, PA) would not refund anything. We pretty much prayed the whole weekend not to be sprayed, and had to clean the toilet every time we sat down! The continuous clanging of the radiators made me glad I brought my ear plugs!",not happy

The hotel is old and tiny, as most hotels in NY, but on the good side, it is quite affordable and conveniently located if you travel to La Guardia (-- bucks for a cab).

"Marriott LAX - --.--.--
 This is a typical large Marriott hotel with all the services you expect. It is very close to the airport terminals, but current arrangements with airport shuttles mean it may take longer to reach the hotel door than you would like. This, plus new LAX security policy, which apparently prohibits walking to and from the area, means that even though you are literally next to the airport, you should plan on more time to get to your room or meeting than you would have in the past.
 Otherwise, we experienced no problems with this property. 
As mentioned in other reviews, the rooms are alarmingly small for such a hotel, reminding one of some of the old New York City hotels that were converted from really old properties but kept the small room sizes. Given prices near the airport, it might pay to shop around for a hotel with more living space if you are going to spend more than a night there. Within a quarter mile of the terminals, there are lots of top hotels to choose from.
 If you are not a frequent visitor to LAX, you should also prepare yourself for the airport’s abysmal conditions and expect it to take you maybe twice as long to negotiate outbound departures. Security procedures are closer to those in third world airports and the domestic and international terminal areas are well behind those in some other major USA airports and disorganized, despite the waves of TSA (read as “Thousands Standing Around”), personnel shuttling your checked baggage from one place to another. The absurdity of the three stage international departure exercise challenges both logic and patience as you must first check in with the airline, then physically carry your checked baggage to the TSA X-Ray point which is always backed up and understaffed, then go and get in line a third time for the usual mindless check of your carry-on and person. This routine may also include undue harassment from private security personnel at various locations. 
 Plan at least three hours for portal to portal, hotel front door to airline gate, to be safe. 
 Still, the hotel is convenient if you must be in or go through LAX and sometimes you have little choice. If you arrive there from overseas, prepare yourself for long waits, first at immigration and then at customs. Returning from Japan, we spent two hours after we got our luggage getting through US government check points. Private security personnel were the rudest encountered in many years anywhere, so again, prepare yourself for “The LAX Treatment.” 
 As other reviews show, there is no convenient place to eat except at other nearby hotels, so plan accordingly. Food and beverage inside the hotel was acceptable, but nothing outstanding or memorable.
 Because of hotel chain loyalty, I would go back there again, assuming I got a competitive rate, but my future planning will try to avoid LAX altogether.",happy

I would definitively stay there again, and highly recommend it.",happy

The hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhood,the subway is just a few blocks away and there's a Turkish Deli just down the road for breakfast (they serve food all day).

"Stayed here for one night and wasn't impressed. To be fair, there was a large restaurant convention-trade show going on in Chicago, but then again - when ISN'T there always a large convention in Chicago? The hotel was extremely busy and crowded. Check-in took forever and when I got to my room, I discovered it was a smoking room. Went back and had to stand in line all over again... the staff were pleasant, but I was not impressed with all the extra charges. Not only was it extra to use the internet (which I've come to expect) but also to use the fitness centre? They try to sell you a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""business package"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for an extra $-- that includes internet and fitness, but that's just cheap. Rooms were incredibly small and the bathroom especially so. I didn't use the pool (was over-run with kids-families when I checked) or fitness room.

"There are many options near Broadway, Times Square, and Rockefeller Center and we chose this one because we got an airfare deal through Orbitz. We also chose it because of it's quirky, artistic theme and reviews who told of a quiet room. The bed linens were white and fluffy with plenty of pillows and blankets. The bathroom was black marble with tons of white towels and toiletries. They provided a nice wall mounted t.v., nice hair drier, terry bathrobes, and other normal comforts. It was a normal, average size NYC hotel room (tiny) with normal concierge service. They offered only cold, weak coffee in the morning and the wine hour was too early in the evening and probably designed to bring in restaurant patrons. We never attended but walked through it on our way out. The street is dingy and small but right in between Ave of America's and Times Square. There is a fantastic deli market next store for wine and sandwiches. The biggest plus was that they stored our luggage before check in so we weren't burdened during our first day in the city.",not happy
"This is a perfect hotel for those interested in the grandeur of the past. The housekeeping service was quick, clean and efficient. Tea was lovely, except the server was not very engaged. On the other hand, the bartender in the lounge was outstanding. Terrific stories of the past. If you are looking for flat screen tvs and sleek duvets with trendy touches-this is not the place.

"We are from the tri-state area and often go into the city for a weekend night or two at a time. We know the city very well, having lived there for years, and we decided to give the Omni a try because of its proximity to our weekend activities. Upon check-in, the front desk was very friendly, and the lovely older gentleman who checked me in gave us a free room upgrade to a beautiful junior suite! What a nice surprise! I grabbed a fresh apple out of the bowl at the front desk, and headed up to my upgraded room. The suite was very spacious, though it had no view, despite its being on the --th floor. The furnishings and carpeting were updated. Overall, the room looked very clean but pretty basic. Our hallway was quiet, and the ac and shades made sleep come very easily. Very convenient to the M subway. We got room service the next morning, which arrived very quickly but was, as we expected, also very expensive. It was not the nicest hotel in which we've stayed in the city, but it certainly wasn't the worst either. I would stay again if the rate was right, but it's not exactly a memorable hotel experience.",happy
"Just returned from New York, stayed in Radisson Lexington. Much better than reviews suggested. Upgraded to a Suite without asking. Although work at building across the Street did'nt bother us. Good location, New York is a walking City. Offered a -p.m. late check out by very obliging Night Manager. Will stay here again. Good value for this area.",happy
"We were looking forward to our stay after reading the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We booked a deluxe room and on arrival we were shown a room with peeling wallpaper, marked skirting boards.
After pointing out the description of a deluxe room to the Manager we were offered another room which initially seemed fine.
However the view was of a department store roof & service yard. There seem to be some sort of electrical engine running somewhere below our room, which could be heard throughout the night. On the final morning we were woken at -:--am by the waste disposal truck. When using the shower the whole room vibrated! No tea or coffee facilities in the room, it is available in the hotel lobby in the morning.
On a positive note the staff were very friendly and the location was good.",not happy
"I stayed at this hotel with my mother and my friend. As -- year old girls, we were not impressed by the lack of things to do in the nearby vicinity, and the overall location. We drove to Boston, but preferred to walk to the T stations rather than deal with the awful traffic. Walking around this area was not bad during the day, but did not feel completely safe at night. It is not close enough to any of the major sites in Boston, much to our dismay. If I were ever to stay in the city again, I would much rather pay the extra money to stay close to the sites than stay at this hotel. 
There is a gas station next door that had been robbed the first day we got there. There is also a McDonald's and another gas station across the street, but that is pretty much it. The panhandlers at the nearby intersection were not very welcoming upon our arrival to this hotel.
The breakfast area was completely chaotic, since it is small and there were not enough tables to accomodate everyone. We had to wait for the other guests to finish before we could sit. 
Also, the elevators were quite slow and we often found it more convenient to take the stairs.",not happy
The hotel is your typical Hampton Inn. The rooms are pretty standard and what is expected from a Hampton Inn. The location is very good as it is very close to the Space Needle and EMP. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The breakfast area gets very crowded in the mornings. There are not enough tables for the number of guests that stays here.,happy
"I really liked this hotel a lot. It was a nice place with great art and a great and attentive staff. We were booked to stay for just one night, but we arrived into the city really early, like -AM and they were really accomodating. I loved the decor of the place though at times it did bother me because I was afraid I would break something and have to pay for it. 
For a first time in the city, the location (for a person trying to be a tourist) was great. It was really close to everything Times Square- Theater District. Not to mention that it was right next to Havana Central, a great Cuban place that has even been in movies. 
I can't say enough about the beds, they were absolutely amazing, just ridiculously large and comfortable. Every time I went anywhere near the bed I just had to get in it! 
My only problem with this place was the size of the room. To use the bathroom I had to sit on the toilet, scrunch my legs and then close the door. The room was so compact that by the timeI put my rather large suitcase on it's stand and got comfy there wasn't really any walking space. Aside from that one thing, I loved it and I would definately go there again!",happy
"Check-in staff seemed bored with their job, We waited -- minutes for valet parking while - employees worked with a guest who's vehicle was damaged by the valets -- we finally unpacked the car and carried our own luggauge. We ate at the attached restuarant -- Tex's -- we were the only table in the place and it took an hour and a half for sandwhiches. Beds were very comfortable and the TV was good.",not happy
"I booked this hotel because of the fab reviews and wasn't disappointed! I spent a long weekend here back in October -- to celebrate my partners --th Birthday and he was very impressed with the hotel as well. The staff were lovely and helpful and the cheese and wine on offer each afternoon-early evening was a very impressive extra touch! 
The location is fantastic and our room which was at the back of the hotel was perfect. Our friends did have a room on the front which they said was a bit noisy but I guess you have to expect that in NYC! 
All in all this is a great hotel and I would definately stay here again and I haven't done that with any of the other hotels I have stayed in in NYC!",happy
"Supposedly an expensive business hotel, but service was extremely poor! E.g. bought -- hour internet access (which is -- USD - rediculous ist not free) and asked how to use it on more devises and was told that was not possible. When asking to use it only on the iPad istead og Phone that it was bought from the consegier said 'tjats not possible - once you buy the purchase is made' - and then hung up!!! I was chocked! Not from the internet issue itself but from the extremely lousy service! I recommend you dont go here - definately not value for money also considering the noisy air con, the drain in the bath tup not fast enough to drain the water When you shower etc etc etc....",not happy
"I have stayed at this hotel over -- times over the last - years and it is very reliable. The rooms are clean, albeit some are very small with very unusual bathroom configurations, but I guess that since I stay at corporate rates, I tend to get the smaller rooms. The hotel floors are gigantic and you can sometimes feel like you walk a mile to get to your room, but it is fairly priced and a minor inconvenience. The rooms are fully-equiped (iron, hair dryer, etc) and I can only remember one time when something didn't work. 
The lobby is to die for and is a glorious place. No matter how many times you stay here, look up at the ceiling and you will be wowed yet once again. The location is great, right in the heart of everything. I recommend this hotel.",happy

The bars in this place are hot. My kids didn't really care.. :)",happy

"We stayed - nights at this hotel. We felt safe, guard ---- circling the building. Breakfast buffet was good, clean, friendly. Convenient to Henry Ford Museum and the Village next door to the museum. Dearborn Heights is a clean trendy area. 
The museum was interesting, thought we would see new concept cars but we didnt,. More about transportation. Greenwich village next door which is suppose to represent a village --- years ago was a little disappointing. I wouldnt go back. They had glass blower, someone making tin plates, which you can see at craft fairs.Had corn growing in a field,. guess if you have never been out of a city you would find it interesting. 
It was in the --s while we were visiting which made it uncomfortable but thats mother nature.",happy
"Location is wonderful; I used to live in this neighborhood and it's a great place to take a walk in any direction. Staff was very accommodating and gave me a couple of nice surprises. Decor was stylish, comfy and appropriate for just about anyone. The place just feels good. I'll be back!",happy
"Very nice hotel at reasonable rates. Rooms are average sized for Manhattan. Very clean. An American style buffet breakfast is included, with a reasonable selection of items, including fresh waffles. Does not really compare with an IHOP or restaurant buffet breakfast, but is a great """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""extra"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for a hotel in this price range. Close to everything. Good service, but no concierge, doorman, or bellhops. - rooms per floor. I would compare it to an extra-large, urban, B & B (and this is not a bad thing at all). I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to friends and family.",happy
The building appeared to be a former YWCA and had some very cool historic pictures around the hotel. The room was a good size and the bed was very comfertable to sleep in.,happy
"The Bell hop helped us with our luggage from the taxi and had it up the steps and onto a trolly in a trice! Our flight was early and although our room was not ready we were able to complete the check in formalities and store our luggage . We didn't mind that the room wasnt ready as we were told that we had beeen upgraded. [We had previously emailed to say we were celebrating our silver weddinng and was it possible to be allocated a 'nice ' room]
 We returned - hours later to find the room ready and were pleased with it! we had two windows. One view looking directly down to Times Square and the other looking onto --th st. we were on --th floor. Whilst the room was not huge , it was perfectly adequate for our needs and had a huge wardrobe with iron, ironing board and hairdryer. The only thing that was missing was a kettle and tea and coffee making facilites!
The room was always warm, sometimes a little too hot, but you could always open a window. There was plenty of hot water and the bathroom was well stocked with toiletries.The maid service each day was excellent, we returned each day to find a beautifully cleaned room and bathroom with fresh towels each day.
Whilst the decor might not be to everybodys taste and would fit in the more'traditional' catogory , rather than boutiquie, it provided excellent value for the money.
 The location was second to none. It took about -- minutes to walk to Times square and - minutes to central Park. It is surrounded by places to eat. We used Fluffy,s {an excellent bakery for breakfast. The best cups of tea!} There are a lot of interesting local restaurants if you are prepared to venture a bit further to -th Ave . We found a fantastic place called The Hour Glass, well worth a visit. A - course meal with coffee for --.--!
There are also lots of local deli's and shops around, so you are never stuck for anything! You really can not go far wrong with the Wellington in terms of location and great value for money in central New York!",happy
The only thing good about this motel was a good TV.,not happy
"If you want to be in the middle of the action, this is the place for you! We had a wonderful room on the --th floor right over Time Square. We could look down at any time day or night and see the activities on the street. The staff was friendly, and the room was clean and modern. Good Morning America is broadcast from the Times Square Sudios a half a block away. Truly a great hotel in a great location.",happy
"Has been about -- years since I have been to Palace Hotel. Room was not as nice as
it could have been-worn, uncomfortable bed, no reading lights at bed side, old, worn towels and windows sealed closed.
Room size was adequate and had the feeling of more space with very high ceiling. While the padded hangers in the closet , terry robe and free bottled water were a nice touch there was no in room coffee maker or turn down service offered.
As a classic historical, hotel it is quite incredible- the Garden Court atrium is a work of art.
A plus was free internet in the lobby also Bart to-from the airport is literally steps outside the hotel. 
Since room service was very pricey I ordered a to go meal from the Pied Piper bar-it was very good and inexpensive.",happy
"My husband I stayed here one night in April of ----. The hotel has a beautiful lobby and very friendly and helpful staff. Our room looked over the --th street mall and had a high ceiling. The room and bathroom were spotless. The furniture was in great condition and the bed was comfortable. The linens were fresh, crisp, and clean, but did not have that over-bleached scratchiness. I would stay here again in a heart beat.",happy
"I came last week with some girlfriends and we were just thrilled with the room and the service! Every staff person we dealt with was pleasant and accomodating. We had a very large room for a reasonable rate. A broken toilet handle was instantly fixed and everything else went very smooth. The location was great, many tourism attractions are within walking distance.
Having three kids, I have found it difficult to find hotel rooms that allow five people. The room we stayed in far exceeded our expectations. In addition to two bathrooms and two bedrooms it offered a living room with a kitchenette. This area was great for socializing in when others were ready to hit the sack. The next time I come to Chicago with my family, this is definitely where we're staying.",happy
"We got there on a thursday night and stayed for - nights. The location is great and central to most everything (the river walk, the Alamo, & the Mexican market). The hotel was built in the early ----s and is very elegant looking. The modernizations are as good as one can expect short of tearing the building down & starting fresh. The rooms were decent and the price we got it for was good (around ----night average). The drawback is the crowd of homeless folks across the street in Travis park, but they are not invasive at all.",happy
"I would recommend anyone thinking of staying in this hotel to reconsider immediately and stay at the nearby Hudson hotel instead. 
Although we had booked a 'Superior Room', the room was tiny and most of the furniture fittings and wall coverings had seen better days. On the website the rooms looked spacious light and airy. In reality they were small gloomy and grubby. We had to lift our suitcases over the bed of the L shaped room as there was not room to wheel them past. After looking at the room we called the front desk to ask if alternatives were available. After - attempted calls when the phone went unanswered we finally got through and expressed our disappointment. We were offered a larger room on a higher floor, although we were warned that it did not 'have a view'. The current 'view from the room we were currently in was of the back of a building and a car park, so we decided to take the risk.
The next room we were given had more room only in that the bed was barely bigger than a single, the desk and chair had been removed and the TV was half the size of the previous room. There was not even room anywhere for the coffee machine which had been situated in the bathroom. There was no wardrobe, but there was a small single sized built in cupboard housing electrical and telephone switchgear with a small rail. Although we had booked a room with 'free' WiFi, it did not reach this room, and without a desk I would have been unable to do any work or use my laptop.
I attempted to contact the front desk once more and after another - calls which were unanswered again got through to the front desk. I explained that this room was in no way 'superior' and was in fact smaller and less well equipped than the previous room. I was told that no other rooms were available, but that if we wanted to move back to the first room we were offered I could do so. However I was advised that for an additional $--- we could upgrade to a suite the following day, when bookings were 'wide open'. By this time we were now running late for a dinner appointment, so we agreed to stay in the current room, on condition we could move to a suite the following day. We were told that if we packed our suitcases in the morning when we left the hotel staff would move them to a suite the following afternoon, and we could collect keys when we returned in the evening.
The following morning on leaving the hotel for the day, we handed back our keys asked for confirmation of the move to a suite. We were told in a very offhand manner that there was no possibility of such a move as the hotel was fully booked. The desk clerk disputed that we could have been told the above information about a room change. We then asked to speak to the duty manager who was quite frankly very rude, and was completely unconcerned that our weekend was being ruined. By this time staff had lied to me twice, about the move to the 'bigger' room the previous day, and about a suite being available today. I noticed the manager was smirking at my annoyance and I suggested that this was inappropriate and she laughed in my face. This suggested to me that this staff attitude permeates the hotel, and that no one has any genuine wish to look after their guests needs or satisfaction.
As a frequent business and leisure traveler I have never before experienced such a terrible product, or staff who give the impression that they are completely unconcerned about customer care and satisfaction. I the attitude of the (female) duty manager on the morning of Saturday - June was completely unacceptable for someone in the service and hospitality industry and I cannot understand how on earth she was ever given a position of responsibility. 
 Luckily we moved to the Hudson hotel, which for a similar room rate was in a totally different league, and the staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. When we advised the manger that we were checking out early, she had the audacity to ask what was wrong, and indicated we would be charged for an additional night even though we had spent less that -- hrs in the hotel and were checking out at --am. It was only after further discussion when I indicated I would dispute the charge on my credit card that this was dropped.
The front desk staff and duty manager on Friday - June and particularly Sat - June are quite possibly the worst I have ever encountered.
I would suggest that as any prospective customers of On the Ave hotel choose the Hudson rather than this, dowdy and shabby establishment populated by rude and unpleasant staff.",not happy
"First timers to the Big Apple! Ace Hotel is a great location between Empire State Building and the Flatiron Building. However, after very comfortable sleep Friday night we spent the entire day (- til midnight) discovering the city and returned to a room that had not been cleaned by housekeeping! Raised my concerns, naturally, and was reassured that something went askew with housekeeping. I know, this should NOT happen any where especially at an expensive hip boutique hotel. Management apologized and compensated with a full breakfast of choice in the building's trendy Breslin restaurant after I needed to ask that my husband be treated to breakfast as well. Would we stay there again?....oh probably it is something to experience.",happy
"I LOVED this place! I was lucky enough to get upgraded to their WOW suite and boy did it deliver! It was huge, comfy and very nicely decorated. It had - window seats with what seemed like a twin sized mattress in them with some comfy pillows. Perfect for taking a nap and relaxing in. I had friends up to the room and even w- - guys and - ladies everyone fit comfortably on the couch or in the closest window seat. 
Service was wonderful, but I've come to expect that at a W. The room service was good and fast, also available -- hours a day. We had drinks at Drai's one night and the drinks were great and the atmosphere was fun, perfect way to kick off a conference. 
All in all I really didn't want to check out when it came time to leave! Loved this place and would be back again.",happy
"Red Roof Inn Riverwalk is about a -- minute walk from the Riverwalk. The Riverwalk can't even be seen from the top floor of this hotel! However, if you are attending a conference and can't afford to stay in one of the conference hotels, this is the place to stay. The air conditioning works and was easily adjustable; although noisy it isn't as noisy as a cheap motel. Although it is right next to the freeway and I could see the traffic go by, the soundproofing stopped it from being a problem. The grab-and-go breakfast is adequate; bagels, muffins, juice, coffee, apples and oranges. Out of - breakfasts the coffee machine didn't work one day, the juice machine another day and there wasn't any fruit on another. The muffins were sugar soaked, sugar sprinkled, sugar overload but the bagels were healthier (toaster available) with a choice of spread, cream cheese and jelly (jam). The breakfast area was short on places to sit but it worked out reasonably well as business starts early (by -am) and tourists seemed to eat later. The food area was clean and I didn't see any flies.
The room was large, the bed was very comfortable with plenty of high quality pillows. The bathroom was clean and although they only provided bars of soap and hair shampoo, the soap had a very pleasant almond scent. There was plenty of clothes hanging space and an iron and ironing board. The hair drier was better than some hotel hair driers I've used. There was a safe. The room had two double beds, a dresser, with drawers and a small table with two chairs. The bedside alarm clock worked, the lightning was adequate. The coffee maker could not have been used to boil water for tea without it being coffee-tainted. The tv didn't have a lot of channels and the digital signal froze now-and-again but you could get news, weather, a film or cartoons for the children. The pool was on the side of the hotel next to the freeway flyover but it looked clean. 
I chose not to have my room serviced and I was never disturbed by housekeeping.
The hotel does not have an airport or conference centre shuttle. If the -- minute walk is too much there is a regular bus ($-.-- per trip). The nearest stores are downtown and you have to go about a mile and a half to find a non-tourist supermarket. There are two 'Superdrug' type shops in the Riverwalk area but you have to go further for a pharmacy.
Walking in the opposite direction to downtown, San Antonio is very rundown.
If I had to work in San Antonio again I would stay at this hotel.",happy
"After looking at many hotels in the Boston area for a --night winter getaway, my boyfriend and I chose Hotel --- because it was the best price and had a great location. I don't think we could have made a better choice. Upon check-in, the receptionist, Israel, told us we had an upgraded room, which was amazing, and was kind enough to provide a map and recommend some local places with great food. (Highlights were Thornton's for breakfast on a sunny morning and Trident Bookseller's & Cafe, where you must try the mushroom-fig sandwich.)
We knew we didn't need five-star luxury, just a place to sleep, but were pleasantly surprised by a hotel that is clean, relaxing, and has very comfortable beds. The yellow hallways give the hotel a happy vibe, and the bathrooms are done in white tile that didn't have me questioning the cleanliness. The hotel has free WiFi, unlike some other local hotels that charge you. We had breakfast in the cafeteria downstairs and were happy with the good price and convenience.
The hotel is about --- feet from Back Bay Station on the Orange line, which was very convenient for taking Amtrak in, and about a quarter mile from Copley on the Green line. This made getting back very easy, even with unpleasant winter weather. The hotel is very close to Newbury Street, Trinity Church, and the Boston Public Library and within easy walking distance of the Prudential Center, Museum of Fine Arts, and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, all of which I would recommend visiting. This meant we saved a lot of money by walking instead of taking the Subway.
Overall, I would absolutely stay in this hotel again if I find myself in Boston!",happy
"Stayed here for three nights for a work trip in October with three colleagues. We were all VERY impressed, especially given the rate of $-- a night! The hotel is brand new. The rooms are big, and the beds are very comfortable with updated bedding. The bathroom was very large as well. The hotel is right next to the airport, so I guess that might be one downside, but it was only about a - minute drive to downtown, -- to OSU. The hotel was quiet, clean and felt very safe. I would absolutely recommend this hotel for anyone going to Columbus who isn't worried about staying right downtown.",happy
"My wife and I recently stayed at the Taj Campton and it was one of the best, if not the best, hotel experiences I have ever had. From the moment we arrived, everything was first class. As said in some of the other reviews, Dan the doorman makes a great first impression for the entire hotel! He is a pro.
When we checked in, I off-handedly mentioned that it was our tenth anniversary. Once we settled in to our room, guest services provided us with a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries! I was totally floored that hospitality like that still exists in a big city hotel. Everyone from the front desk staff to housekeeping did all the little things right.
Leigh Ann, the conscierge, really went out of her way to make out stay wonderful. She gave great recommendations for dinner and tours, and we truly felt like she really cared that our stay in San Francisco was the best possible.
I highly recommend this hotel! I will stay there every time I visit San Fran.",happy

"After multiple airline delays and bad weather, we arrived at the hotel with a prepaid reservation only to find that our room had been given away and there were no vacancies. There was a penalty for late cancellation but we already planned for late arrival, as our flight was not scheduled to arrive until --:-- PM. Unfortunately, we did not arrive until after -AM, and their """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""system"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" audits accounts and then allows for rooms to be given to others, despite guaranteed reservations. The front desk clerk was overwhelmed and not helpful, saying she was sorry, but that's the way La Quinta works. It was only after a call to the manager, at my assistance, that they offered to put us up at a hotel down the road, Marriott Courtyard, which not only had rooms but was very pleasand.",not happy
"I really enjoyed my stay here. Aesthetically it was beautiful. Nice + clean modern lines. My room had hardwood floors and high ceilings, which I loved. When I was here, it was mostly cloudy so it did make the room seem a little bit cold and dark (not that much natural light). 
Room + Bathrooms were pretty clean. It was hardwood floors, so I think I noticed the dust around the corners a little more. The sheets were comfortable and so was the bed. We did have a problem with our toilet but they sent someone up immediately to fix it. 
My favorite part was the bench near the windows where you can eat and look down on the street. 
Great location, near the gaslamp and the hotel bar has some crazy good drinks.",happy
"When I was there from August - to August -, the weather was beautiful. The reason I start with this, is that the Washington Plaza has a pool, plenty of chairs to sit to enjoy an afternoon of sun and swimming. The hotel is only - blocks from a subway station which only took me only ----- minutes subway trip from the airport, which was great for only $-.--. 
There are locals that also pay to use the pool facilities, sometimes screaming and loud kids can conflict with paying locals and other guests. The lifeguard on duty is mostly attentive, but is also responsible for ensuring only guests and paying locals are using the pool. 
The location is also convenient to walk to many different places and neighbourhoods, but with such a great air conditioned subway, there are multiple options to get around and see the sites.
The top two floors were finished with renovations; I guess they are working down. I liked my room even though it wasn't renovated. It had a king bed, chair, desk, tv, separate room for toilet and shower from the sink. Free Wi-Fi is always a great feature, which they had at this hotel. The -th floor rooms that face the pool have a shared balcony amongst all other -th floor rooms, this can be something to enjoyed or concerned if you don't mind people walking up and down the entire balcony.
Our group did have some challenges when we asked front desk for a limo for our group to the restaurant and a cube van was delivered. This was very disappointing for the person in our party that booked the limo. 
The fitness room is very basic; the restaurant is nice and friendly. Not very busy so you can get a meal pretty quick. You can also have your food delivered to you beside the pool.
I would stay at this hotel again.",happy
"We always love staying at Residence Inn! This hotel is right on the outskirts of downtown Boston, just north of North End. Upon arriving the front desk arranged for our trolley tour around town and recommended a few restaurants in the area. Warren Tavern is within walking distance and a historic site itself!

"The NY Hilton rates were the highest rate I've ever paid for a hotel room. Was it worth it? Yes and no. As a child, I lived down the street from the hotel and it was part of my daily scenery. I therefore, attained a special satisfaction, staying there.
The room was spacious and clean, with all the fixings one would expect from Hilton. Checking in and out was quick. The personnel were pleasant enough. The location is perfect, close to Central Park, Times Square and the subway. I liked that we weren't IN Times Square where traffic is so often at a stand still. I liked that there was a curved driveway, where we could exit-enter a cab with out feeling rushed. 
For $---+ a night free WiFi and breakfast would have been nice.
Would I stay here again? Probably not.
Do I regret having stayed here? No, not at all. I read multiple reviews and was aware of the pros and cons and it was exactly as advertised and reviewed.",happy

"Stayed at the Legacy Golf Resort for a night in late September as a stopover on a cross country trip. Booked the hotel through hotwire, so it was a reasonable price. 
The grounds and facilities are decent enough, check-in was pretty smooth and there were no major complaints. However, the hotel is a fair distance away from the interstate. Keep that in mind if you're staying for just a night or passing through. If you're staying for a few days and playing golf, the proximity of the interstate probably isn't a big deal. In addition to being a distance away from the interstate, the place was a little difficult to locate, its behind some small farms, etc., and not in a place where you'd expect to find a hotel. 
Aside from the location, this place wasn't really anything special. The decor was a little dated and cheesy looking, and you can tell its a timeshare golf condo rather than a hotel room. We didn't use any of the kitchen facilities since we were just staying for a night. They were installing something in the room next to ours and there was some noise from drilling and hammering while we were staying there, which was fortunately not during hours when we were sleeping. Also our doorbell was randomly rang at - AM and no one was there when we got up and looked...since there isn't any real security and anyone can get on the grounds, we were a little suspcious of that. 
All in all, not terrible for a night's stay, but nothing special. I think it would be more appealing if you were staying a few nights or using the facility for a golf vacation, since its not too close to the interstate.",not happy
"If given the option, we stay at Renaissance hotels. This hotel wasn't as nice as other Renaissance hotels. No complaints because the price was terrific, but I would look at other hotels before booking this one, because there are cheaper w- = quality. The rooms are small (bathrooms are nice size). The lobby was nice, the front desk was friendly. However, the rooms reminded me of a renovated Crowne Plaza. The beds are comfortable, but I wasn’t impressed with the pillows. We always get upgraded, but didn’t here. We ordered room service one night and only one meal out of three was correct, when you are ordering a $-- grilled cheese, you expect perfection :-) The pool area was nice, but the hot tub didn’t have enough water and it took well over hours upon reporting to get filled, I don’t even know how long because we didn’t stay any longer. In short, I would recommend this hotel to a friend if it was the right price, but there are other hotels I would first recommend. The location is okay, but I have enjoyed other locations more too. You might not be disappointed, but there are better deals out there. Oh, and parking is $-- per night.",not happy
"I had visited DC for my daughters college orientation at American University. I have never driven in DC before. The trip was overwhelmingly long and then was lost in DC. They were so kind on the phone, guided me to the hotel, parked my giant Dinali for me and just made constantly sure I was o.k. They knew how stressed my trip was and were so intuned to providing me the best service. I was by myself with my young son and needed to drive back and forth to the college. Not an easy feat! 
The rooms were reasonably priced when you look at DC pricing, the room was spotless, and the bed was so comfortable. It was in a perfect spot in Georgetown near everything. I will be coming to this hotel everytime I come to visit my daughter in DC now. What a relief to have someone take such good care of you after all the stress of travel.",happy
"We booked into the Bryant Park Hotel during the three days of the AdTech conference. The welcome was exceptionally warm and efficient. Everyone from the bellmen to the chamber maids smile and greet you. The evening complimentary open bar is another wonderful touch. When room service says they'll be there in -- minutes they really are on time. When my wife wanted a blow-dry and manicure the concierge offered a myriad of nearby choices and made the appointment for her. We live in the nearby suburbs but from time to time stay in NY. I wouldn't hesitate to again stay at the Bryant Park. Oh and it's across the street from Bryant Park with its lovely ice rink, NY Public Library is around the corner, the theater district and -th Ave, shopping is a short walk. Loved it.",happy
"Our room was nicely appointed and was as pictures portrayed, it was right on the river although quite a walk to where the restaurants and shops were located unless you went by street which we did. The lobby was fantastic staff very friendly, parking drive was a bit crazy and scary since everybody was driving in and out very fast and it was extremely crowded but that goes with staying in a downtown hotel. The bed was not their heavenly bed as we expected and expect from Westin. I suspect they either substituted a cheaper replacement or something because it was horrible. We were close to street and the noise was enough to drive you crazy, I don't know where it all came from but we heard kids and adults carrying on till the wee hours. The room A-C control is one of those fake controls, you can't change the temp and it wouldn't matter if you tried, you will get what they want you to have. So it's enough to survive, better than outside, but NOT comfortable. After walking a long way to and from the restaurant we would have enjoyed a comfortable bed and some a-c with --% humidity so we were disappointed. We paid $--- plus plus plus so the total tab for - night was $---.-- using priceline and paying for valet parking. We expect to pay $-- for parking despite the parking garage charging $-- for -- hours but the valets drive your car like mad men, don't like that. It was in a covered parking spot and they were prompt to deliver it when we were ready to leave. 
So when you stay on the river be prepared to pay a lot and enjoy you room minimally even in a --star facility. It's noisy, expensive, and most are not maintained as well as they should be, parking is overpriced, you have to tip everyone for everything but if you want to stay on the Riverwalk it's part of it. I'd never pay their rack rates or call direct for reservations, knowing what I know I'd always do Priceline if you want to endure all that it takes to stay on the Riverwalk. I'd suggest like what we did, stay one night on the Riverwalk and then stay elsewhere to relax. We stayed the -nd night at the Hyatt Hilton Ranch Resort via Priceline of course and we enjoyed it tremendously.",not happy

We stayed for two nights and for the trouble they gave us one night free. But we didn't want a free night we wanted to have WIFI!!!!,not happy
"As a family of -, hotel prices in New York City were looking steep. Then I found a quad room at very reasonable rates in the Cosmo. I have a very fussy husband, so with the the risk of eternal damnation if it wasn't great, I booked a room for - nights. I realised that with a lot of luggage we might be cramped so I booked a queen-queen-sofa-bed (i.e. could sleep -). 
As it turned out, it was above his expectations. True, we had no view but the widesceen TV in what must be one of their largest rooms made up for this. Free wi-fi access too although if you want to print boarding passes, save them to pdf and put them on a memory stick - for about - bucks you can get them printed out up the street. The beds were hard but this seems to be a trend these days. Aircon was extremely efficient. Cleanliness and daily service were good. Don't let the lack of restaurant put you off although I would recommend taking a bottle of water up at night. Under the hotel is a wonderful Soda Shop for breakfast and the fabulous Cosmo Cafe where we had coffee and cheesecake by candlelight one night. They also do romantic dinners. We highly recommend both establishments and there is a Starbucks too if you must. 
The hotel is situated right next door to the Chambers St. subway entrance for lines -,-,-. Beware there are several entrances, depending on which line you travel. Print out your subway map before you go at [--]
It isn't very far from the former Twin Towers but we found this to be a site of optimistic regeneration.
We were very organised and had a full itinerary, but - whole days was about right to do everything we wanted, including a show and the Metropolitan museum. If I ever go back I would stay at the Cosmo again. We also met a many-time repeat visitor, surely a good sign.
 Other tips for travellers to NY:
Downtown = South
Book tickets on the internet in advance for EVERYTHING to save some time queueing and beware long lines in peak periods. Pay attention to security requirements. Walk to Battery Park for the Liberty-Ellis Island cruise - this was our best value for money trip but book well in advance for a morning slot or your time at the Statue of Liberty will be limited (ours was slightly curtailed).",happy
"The staff at this facility was friendly, attentive and looking to please. It was clean and well-appointed. The room in which I stayed was newly-renovated, was laid out nicely and had great amenities for the business guest.
HOWEVER -- I have never had worse restaurant service than at the Blue Wave Bar & Grill. I had to ask for a menu, keep asking for my water glass to be refilled, tracked down and reminded the waiter about my missed cup of soup when the meals were delivered and my soup appetizer wasn't. We waited for what seemed like eons waiting for a waitperson to place orders, and then twice as long to have it served. There were two waiters, trying their best to pretend we were invisible.",happy
"this was a lovely boutique hotel that was suggested to us by a friend. located right next to the state capitol and boston common, in an ideal walking around location. the employees were all very energetic and willing to help us out with anything that we needed. plus, as a dog lover, i love the fact that they allow well trained dogs in the hotel.",happy
"This hotel is by far one of the nicest we've stayed. We got a Corner King-View of the space needle for New Years Eve and the view of the fireworks was unbeatable. The staff was incredibly nice and bent over backwards to make our one night stay unforgettable. The room was unique, clean and had views that really made our stay. I would recommend this room and hotel to everyone!",happy
"First the positive - excellent location for Grand Central Station, Bloomingdales, Time Square, Top of the Rock and Central Park.
Arrived with wife on -th Oct having booked a standard room for - nights for - adults. On entering -th Floor Room alloacted, seriously thought we had been given a single room as bed was small and only towels for one in bathroom. Room was dark, stuffy and very noisy . Questioned the size of room with reception staff only to be told in no uncertain terms that this was a standard room which I had booked. I was unable to pay for an upgrade as informed there were only - other rooms available and all were of the standard quality.I was then shown the button on the phone that I would need to press to contact housekeeping for extra towels, but the guy on reception said he would press it 'this time' and arrange for additional towels to be sent (Wow service at its best !!!).
On returning to the room found my wife cleaning the skirting boards of accumulated dust and grime. The bathroom was very tired with the shower producing nothing more than a dribble and the shower head had seen better days. Both the bath and basin has surface cracks and scratches which were stained. On turning on the air conditioning found that it drowned out any conversation and the sound from the tv. The windows in the room provided no sound proofing from the sounds of the street and therefore as New York never sleeps neither did we !!!
Unable to rest at all with the air conditioning switched on so room gradually became uncomfortable through the night.
Deadlock on the door also was faulty and did not work so security was a concern.
Overall wouldn't stay here again as there has to be better hotels in similar location. The whole place is tired once youve risen above the lobby and needs a refurb. Please start with the windows, bathrooms and carpets.",not happy
"This is a very hip place that even an oldster like me can enjoy. The rooms are modern, trendy and have amazing walk in showers. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. You walk down the hallway and depending upon the time of day, the noises change (babbling brook, birds chirping, owls, etc.) Conveniently located to the miracle mile, theater, great restaurants, etc. this has become my go to place when in Chicago.",happy
"We reserved a suite for the first week of July ----, and couldn't have been more pleased. Entire hotel was fastidiously clean. Room bright and doors to close on the bedroom side if needed. Plush robes and bath amenities. Friendly, helpful staff. On site parking. Plenty of places to eat and drink and a wonderfully helpful shuttle driver to provide any details you may need. All in all, a terrific stay.
Thanks!",happy
"I like the Hilton brand hotels and stay frequently. Booked the brand new HGI Inner Harbor for a weekend family getaway. I was delighted but disappointed all in the same trip. The pros - the hotel is brand new and the location is fabulous - close to all inner harbor attractions. Since the hotel is new, it is very very clean (spotless actually) and the rooms are modern and cozy. They are a little small, but I find that common with any big city hotel. But overall, I was satisified w- the accomodations. We had a room on the --th floor (top floor) with a nice view of the inner harbor. The odd # rooms face towards the harbor-city. The cons are that because the hotel was new, I think the staff was too. Service can use a Hilton make over. Check in was very slow. The clerk seemed genuinely unwelcoming and uninterested that I chose his hotel to stay in. He provided no information and barely made eye contact. The hotel is co-located w- the Homewood Suites by Hilton so be careful to go to the correct desk & elevators. Homewood clerks had no action but stood at their stations staring at - of us in line to check in to the HGI without offering any of us assistance. When I got to my room the card keys didn't work and my wife had to keep my three small children out in the hall while I went back down to rectify the problem. I barely got an apology and was told I probably put them next to my cell phone (meanwhile my cell was in my bag on the baggage cart so it was impossible for that to have happened). I told the guy that wasn't the case and he just handed me my keys and said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""here you go."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Not Hilton-esque service! After we got settled, we attempted to order room service but the book in the room didn't have a menu. We called to ask for one and I actually had to go down to the restaurant to go get one (that's what the staff suggested when I called). They said they hadn't gotten the in-room menus yet. No offer to bring one up to us.
To access the pool, you need a separate pass to the health club (non Hilton facility in the same building, but guests can get in with a pass and photo ID ). Ask at check in b-c they don't tell you about it when you do check in. Also, you should inquire about parking so you can get an in-out access card - again you aren't told by the staff, you have to ask for everyting. It's $-- but that is actually a bargain for the area especially with in-out priveleges. Main attractions are in walking distance anyway.
Ate breakfast at the Great American grill. Food was good but very slow at the counter - they cook to order eggs, pancakes, etc.. There was a wedding party so that may have contributed. Restaturant staff was friendly and helpful, but again, you could tell the hotel was new in operation and all parts weren't moving in the same directions quite yet. We walked by the General Manager's office on the way out and he looked up with a mean grimmace. Not even a good morning or anything. Not so friendly like I'm used to at other Hiltons.
Overall, I was pleased with the room, the cleanliness, and the location. The level of service needs to be improved for me to consider it of Hilton quality. I would call my stay an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Ok"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" experience and I would consider it again after the staff was properly trained and had some experience under there belt.",not happy
"I completely agree with comments that rate this hotel poorly. I stayed there with my family for a week last July and we didn't enjoy that. It's a gloomy and deteriorated property (my room had a very old and broken sofa bed and window shades that didn't work) and the neighborhood, in spite of its convenient location and nearness to subway station and local attractions, gets scary at night. The valet service took forever to bring out car (in one occasion, we had to wait for -- minutes).

"We stayed here in August for a short family vacation. Great location, beds are comfy, rooms are clean. Staff is friendly. Pricey - but the location cannot be beat. We chose this because we were going to a Cubs night game and it is close to the El. The Redline (stop is about a block from the hotel) takes you right to Wrigley Field. Valet parking is $--. Self parking is about $--. Pool is small.

"I just spent - nights in a room on the --th floor of the Loews Philadelphia. The first night was fairly quiet, but the street noise was audible. I got little sleep the other two nights. I woke up several times on night - due to slamming doors and loud voices in the hallway. On night -, there were more slamming doors and a loud staff-worn walkie talkie outside my door at -am.
I expected the room to be cleaner and less worn than it was. The wallpaper in the bathroom appeared to have been wiped down with dirty water, and it was beginning to peel off the walls. Also, I found a penny and part of a food wrapper on the floor in the bedroom. 
I would not stay here again.",not happy
"Chose this hotel as it was close to the event we were attending this past weekend. It was a bit hard to get to as it's on a one way access road. But we found it ok. The hotel is very clean & the service at the desk was outstanding. The rooms were clean & the beds comfy. However, the walls are paper thin. Could hear the neighbors TV, people talking in the hall (full conversations), etc. I had earplugs, so I didn't hear any if it until I removed them. Hubs heard it all, as he didn't use his earplugs. Got a good rate, the hotel was nice & it served it's purpose. Would I stay here again? Yes.",not happy

"We booked this hotel primarily because of location - ideally situated to Capitol Hill and Union Station AND roof-top pool for the kids to cool off this past summer. The pool was great apart from the fact there was some big fraternity gathering in the city whith purple shirts everywhere - and basically overtook the pool on the second day, but that was not the hotel's fault.
Rooms are well designed. Staff friendly, apart from the cafe staff who were, I believe, used to hob-nobbing with Capitol Hill business people so not great if you're """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""just a tourist""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""!!

"What an excellent hotel. We can't find a single thing to criticise about this place.
The location is perfect - less than a block from Times Square but still quite quiet. The street outside is a little bit rough but not threatening in any way.
The hotel itself is on the small side, and all the better for it. The staff are friendly and helpful; the lobby welcoming, rooms clean and beautifully decorated (and ours had a bath), delicious contintental breakfast, free wine and beer happy hour every day.

"When we made arrangements to attend a function at the nearby Smart Center, the business manager suggested this hotel as convenient to their location (and all the other dealerships on --th). It was also very reasonably priced. So I called to verify vacancies for the date we would need a room, and the room rate. I was disappointed to hear that there were no king sized beds- (so we booked a full-queen), and there was no room service available. I was pleased that the room rate was so low (I haven't stayed in a hotel for less than $-- since people were break dancing in parachute pants!) and I was happy to hear that there was a pizza place that delivered to the hotel and there were several nice restaurants nearby, so I made the reservation.
A few days later, I realized I had not received my confirmation email. So, to be """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""on the safe side"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (read, because my other half insisted), I called to make sure we had a room reserved. It was a good thing I did (read, yes, she was right) because there was no record of my reservation in their computer, and we did not have a room reserved, despite my phone reservation. The hotel manager was apologetic, and quickly booked our room for the original quoted rate and sent me an email confirmation.
The night we checked in, the GPS eventually got us to the hotel, but using the GPS we had to drive through a residential subdivision. Ordinarily, this would not be a big deal, but this particular neighborhood has the largest speed bumps running across the road that I have ever seen. Seriously, who needs speed bumps nearly a foot high? Who needs speed bumps a foot high every -- feet for a quarter of a mile? After slowly dragging the underside of our car over the third or fourth speed bump, and gritting our teeth to the sound of metal and plastic grinding against these asphalt speed humps from hell, I decided to turn back and find an alternate route. The GPS found one- by going only one block further, and it took us directly to the hotel parking lot- without any speed bumps... 
We arrived at --:--pm (we had changed time zones on the drive), and the clerk quickly got us checked in. We were disappointed to learn however, that all of the nearby restaurants, bar and grill places, even the fast food joints, cater specifically to the nearby businesses and as a result, all of them, and I mean all of them, closed at - or --pm. Because it was a week night, even the pizza place closed early. In short, there are only - places within several miles to get any sort of food in this area after --pm- Mc D's, or BurgerK. So, after hours of driving, we had to get back in the car and head out for a paper sack full of drive-thru, deep fried, greasy grub, and a couple of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cokes.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
As for the room, the room itself was small, but not as small as some of the hotel rooms I've stayed in, our room was probably around -- x --. The kitchenette is open to the room and there is a small table separating the spaces. There is not enough room for a sofa, but there was a recliner parked in the corner. There was nothing in the room that wasn't functional or appeared to be heavily used or dirty. The ac appeared to be newer, and worked fine. The room was very clean, but appeared somewhat dated. We did not use the appliances, except for the refrigerator and the coffee maker- both of which worked fine (the coffee was awful however-bring your own if you can). The bathroom was very clean and it had a full size tub with a shower. The water pressure was good, and there were no problems with temp fluctuations during bathing. Oddly, there was no shampoo in the shower, and when we noticed this the next morning we remembered that a guest came down while we were checking in to get shampoo. Maybe shampoo is provided upon request or something like ketchup at the McD's drive thru?... The bed was very firm (I had no problem, but the wife didn't sleep well because it was too firm for her). The pillows were the typical synthetic, non-allergic spun polyester type (which should make all of the asthmatics in your party giggle with glee) but if you use just one pillow, your head will sink to the mattress, (which I suppose could also be an issue for stomach sleepers...)
The next morning, We looked out the window to find the parking lot nearly completely empty, and commented on the fact that we never heard any sounds from outside of our room. With the exception of the repeated, high pitched, angry screaming and squeals of someone's precious little darling outside our door """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""No!, I want the ...(something or other)"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as we packed up to check out, we never heard anything from the adjoining rooms or the hallway. So noise was generally not a problem.
Checkout was easy, and took all of twenty seconds. We were not disappointed with the hotel for the amount it cost for us to stay there. We probably will not stay there again, because we honestly don't really have a reason to return to the area. I think for a business professional who doesn't have an expense account, and isn't reimbursed by his or her crooked employer for overnight stays in this area however, it would be a good, inexpensive option, as long as you are able to hit the nearby restaurants before -pm, you double check your reservation, bring your own pillow, coffee and shampoo and you don't expect the four seasons or the fairmont for $--.",happy
"This was a modestly less expensive alternative to a conference hotel. It's not a luxury hotel, and the gym facility is small with only - treadmills, but the rooms were a good size and well maintained and the facility overall was well kept and convenient to everything in the area.

"We stayed at Hotel -- for - nights. Check-in was easy and done within minutes. Very friendly staff. Small lobby. We had a room on the sixth floor for the three of us [double and twin bed] with a private bathroom. The elevator is a bit small and oldish but big enough for three people with suitcases. 
I was expecting a small room after reading some reviews here but i was a bit surprised to see how 'big' it was, it surely was big enough for - people. Enough space to store multiple suitcases near the coat rack. Room was spotless & clean. Bed's were nice, clean and comfortable. Shower was nice, always warm water. The airconditioning worked fine although we didnt had to use it very much due to the bad weather. Every day there was maid service. In the room there's a TV with Fox, NBC, CNN, Weather Channel and some other channels, there's a coffee machine next to the TV, a hairdryer in the bathroom. I once forgot my mobile phone but at the end of the day it was still there. Always felt safe while staying at the hotel. There's also always someone from the staff present at the desk in the lobby.
Location: nice and safe neighborhood and within a half minute walk of the subway #- [walk towards Park Ave then towards --nd Street] which can bring you uptown to Grand Central Terminal [one stop] or downtown all the way to Union Square Station, Chinatown and lower Manhattan. Within three blocks of the hotel there are enough places to buy food like two Duane Reade's [supermarket], Starbucks, deli at the corner, Subway, Dunkin Donuts [on the corner of --st & Park Ave], McDonalds and it's like --- blocks or so from the Empire State Building, -th Avenue and other shopping locations [i.e. Manhattan Mall, Macy*s]. Location is very good so to speak.
After check-out you can leave your luggage for free in their storage room which you have to collect within -- hours. Hotel staff arranged us a ride back to JFK airport with a fixed rate! So we didnt had to hail a yellow cab. Price was $-- including tip and toll. So ask them about this as a yellow cab won't use a flat rate like when you're travelling from JFK to Manhattan. Even with trafficjams it only took like a hour to get from the hotel to JFK.
Last thing, although we had a private bathroom, we always noticed when leaving the hotel in the morning or coming back at night that the shared bathroom was always available so if you have thoughts about having to wait in line when making a reservation for a room with a shared bathroom.. this surely ain't the case. 
I definitely looking forward to return to this hotel when visiting NYC again! We had a great time staying in NYC and at Hotel --.",happy

"The location and history of this hotel is brilliant.
Brilliant for proximity to all the Hollywood icons, across the road from the Chinese Theatre, on the Walk of Fame, a very short walk to the Metro that takes you one stop to Universal Studios, to lots of restaurants and shops.
Brilliant for Hollywood history buffs, the hotel is steeped in history associated with movie stars and the Academy Awards.
That said, it seems to have very little interest in guests who have chosen to stay there who are not part of the latest fashion shoot, TV shoot or party animals getting drunk around the pool. 
We booked a room, through an agency, which was supposed to ajoin the garden or pool area. The room was not cheap, I had previously stayed there in a similar room a few years ago. After checking in we were shown to a room on the -st floor overlooking a car park at the rear of the property. After reading more recent reviews of the hotel I was alert to the many complaints and chose to complain up front and be quite ascertive that this was NOT the room I had booked and paid for. The desk clerk was not so much apologetic but quickly assigned another room, which was all he could offer, another first floor one, this time with a balcony overlooking the garden and similar in design as the one I had booked over the net.
Be alert to what you have booked and be ready to grumble. Not really what you'd like to expect for the prices they charge here.
This hotel features more and more on video clips, MTV, ET, E! News, Entourage and other pop culture outlets and as a guest you get a sense that this is where the Roosevelt's priorities lie. You will pay for its 'coolness' and not for what should be its more worthy qualities.",not happy

We walked in an were happy because it was just like the pictures that was until we sat down and noticed all the dust and pieces of trash under and behind the furniture.Even in the LOBBY! They don't even vacume the rooms! It was gross. Iam a very clean person and that bothered me alot. For the price and overall value I guess it's ok if you don't mind walking or having your kids play on the dirty carpet. I would not stay there again. The shower curtain is a joke, water gets out of the shower and puddles on the bathroom floor. The staff isn't at all nice they act as if they are doing you a favor by allowing you to stay there, theyre very pushy and lazy. Jeff the shuttle guy was the only nice person there.

"We found the room adequate as we were only here from -pm to - am each day as we were at the theme parks all days it had what we wanted a bed, shower and toilet. The hotel is part of a large complex and has buildings A, B & C. It needs a renovation on mainly small items such as painting and our toilet door stuck and would not close, the front door was also hard to close. There are rust marks on hinges and edges of walls so as I said needs some basic repairs and attention. The staff at check in were friendly and they had some discount vouchers for the theme parks. It is in a good location being around a ten minute drive from SeaWorld and San Diego zoo and about a -- minute drive to Lego land. There is also banks, supermarket and shops across the road or short walk.
This best feature was the attached restaurant which had great meals and breakfast in fact the breakfast ranked in our top breakfast over our -- days in the US.

"For a LA wedding, this was a super convenient & nice hotel: could walk to church and close to all event locations. We booked a King Spa Suite & were upgraded to Vista Suite with a great view, the upgrade was def appreciated. I had read many helpful TripAdvisor reviews about the hotel, and planned our stay accordingly. A very positive experience and hope to be back!
Here're the major pros & cons (not many):
Pros:
-. Spacious suite & really nice bathroom (though could use more counter space & places to hang extra towels or clothes).
-. Daily NYT, including the weekend's. Do not remember if we choose this preference? It was great to have. There were also other papers in the lobby every morning.
-. Heated outdoor pool: there were plenty of towels and seating, though I expect it'll be much busier during summer.
-. Morning coffee & tea bar: it was very well supplied & well maintained.
-. On Sat evening we got a call about printing Boarding Passes for Sun's flights. This is such a nice reminder service, and it was easy to use the Concierge kiosk to print.
-. Valet service was always prompt & helpful. One day I even asked them to get a relative's car when I didn't have the ticket number, I gave them guest name & car description and that was enough. 
There have been a lot of TripAdvisor discussions of the valet daily charge, we used it and felt it's worthwhile. while some relatives chose to park on the streets which have plentiful free parking esp during Sat-Sun.
-. Staff all very helpful & courteous, from Reception-Valet-Housekeeping-restaurant.
-. Fitness room wasn't cramped and had a partial view, very clean & well stocked with towels. BLVD --'s private room(s) were perfect for groups.
Cons: 
-. We requested an in-room coffeemaker but it was not delivered in time.
For late sleepers it'd be nice to have a morning hot drink in the room.
-. Business Ctr is not free for Kimton InTouch members.
There is free in-room Wi-Fi for members but sometimes need to use Internet away from room-not via laptop.",happy

"This hotel caters to folks who need to be near the airport (LAX). It's in a nice neighborhood with a supermarket and a bowling alley next door. I was on the sixth floor with a decent view of the LA area. I think you can see the ocean from the other side (East) of the building. My room was spacious with a comfortable bed. Mini fridge and expensive water (hotel prices). With a supermarket next door, you can get more bottled water for less. I really liked the massage chairs in the lounge on the --th floor. They are free of charge and just the thing you need after a long flight. Staff were all friendly helpful. Place is clean. I had my own car, and had to park on a nearby street. Front desk warned not to park at the supermarket as you will get towed.",happy

"I had an excellent stay at the Chancellor. From the moment I arrived the staff was welcoming and very helpful, and every staff member I encountered during my stay was very polite. The Chancellor was located perfectly for me. A couple blocks from the conference I was attending, right on the trolley car line, close to many restaurants, and a block from the gym that they are connected with rather than having a small workout facility on site. The gym was a nice bonus, as it was close and the staff there treated me like I was one of their members, getting to participate in group excercise classes as well as have full access to the rest of the workout equipment and the pool. The room was comfortable, and I was able to get a good night's sleep each night, and enjoyed trying out some different pillows from their pillow menu. Staff was helpful with giving directions to anywhere I needed to go and they recommended a great restaurant upon request.",happy
"The staff at the hotel were friendly, funny and competant-- very pleasant and gave us an upgrade without asking. We had a complicated set of family reservations, via orbitz, and everything worked out, despite changes. 
One thing to watch out for: parking. the valet parking fills up and you have to park at the condos next door (which could fill up too). We heard one patron with a uHaul saying """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I called four times to check if you had room with enough clearance!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as he sat stranded in the middle of chicago.

"We stayed at the Palomar for one night and had a great time. The staff was friendly and accomodating! The rooms were nicely decorated but on the small side. The pool area was relaxing but not spacious - only a few lounge chairs. The food in the restaurant was fantastic. They had a free happy hour in the lobby which was fun! I would say this hotel is pretty, quaint, well appointed but not a full - star. I would stay again for a great price!",happy

"We arrived at this hotel by mistake. I had made reservations at another Marriott and stupidly mapquested the wrong hotel. We were to be in town for only one night in route driving from Florida to Vermont. We had booked a night monument tour so we had a deadline and could not spend the evening trying to find a hotel. I explained my mistake to the front desk clerk who couldn't have been nicer. She cancelled my other reservation and gave me a room for a very good price. She even comped my parking and gave us breakfast for four for free. The room was very nice, and the service was excellent. The staff was very helpful. We had a wonderful breakfast with excellent service (table not buffet). The bill for breakfast would have been $--.-- but was comped. We left in the morning with ice on the roads and the valet telling us exactly how to get out of the downtown area. This was a stupid mistake which turned out to be one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had.",happy
"Boy, you don't get many of these from me! But this hotel stands out in every way. I don't know when I last stayed in an Omni but I'll be checking out a few more in the future based on this. Where to start? Well, I was at an event at the convention center so the location was perfect -but being right downtown it's covenient to the West End for all the restaurants within just a few blocks walking. Ditto JFK sites. The design and functionality of the rooms is amazingly well thought out with surprising and pleasant little touches. The service is spot on. Join their hotel club and get free Internet, discounted parking and morning beverage to your room immediately. I left a shirt in a drawer and they called me the next day and it's on the way. I loved the casual lounge with large chairs and nooks for a drink and relaxation. I could go on but in a nutshell if it is even a consideration to stay here don't consider it... Just do it!",happy
"Stayed three nights on business. 
I had an interior facing room, so no view, but also no traffic noise at night. It was very quiet. The room was quite large. Huge closet.
The bed was very comfortable. Some of the place sleep I've had at a hotel. The bathroom was large and clean.
The lobby was large, with a number of places to sit. This was convenient when waiting for my business partner. Very old school with very ornate decor.
The main dining room, Laural Court, is painted with landscape murals. A lovely room. Wait staff were very old school - literally. Food was so so.
The Tonga Room & Hurricane Bar was a blast. Very different from the rest of the property.",happy
"So as an SPG Platinum, I've come to expect certain things from a W Hotel - it tries a little hard, it feels like a nightclub, but typically a nice hotel, very well kept, great service, rooms are nice if you can get an upgrade especially... 
This W does not live up the brand. We went to NY for a show and although the location is perfect -walking distance to lots of restaurants, shopping, Central Park, the hotel is old underneath all that flashy decor. You can see it in the paneling and the floors and the doors. The rooms are TINY TINY TINY. We were upgraded to third level of room - """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Superior"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" .. superior WHAT? I get the hotel was full, there was a wedding and of course the hurricane displaced people. The bed itself was comfortable. 
The bathroom was so small and the lights kept flickering! The closet was actually as big as the bathroom, but the light didn't work. 
My favorite part of the stay: Sunday morning - for -- minutes, a loud, horrible, blaring noise coming from two doors down. I called and asked about it - was told security was on it, and maybe -- minutes later I heard W staff working on it. Upon checking out, we asked about it .. no answer, no response. 
I also was curious about the security of the hotel. Every night, they had people standing at the elevators asking to see our room keys. The elevators had a place to put your key, that was technically required to get onto the guest level floors, but it didn't seem to work. What was happening at that hotel that they had THREE guys standing at the elevators?

"I checked in and we had reservations for - rooms - each connecting, not only didi that not happen, my room wasn't ready, and I made the reservations for all the couples. Then I wasn't told about a free margarita if your rooms not ready until another quest told be about it. So back to the front desk. Even though I don't drink Margaritas it's the point. The restaurant staff was GREAT. Then the check out, check your bill. I normally stay in hotels that I frquent on a regular basis and don't worry about the bill. I was charged for - vehicles a day and called them that day to discuss and was told accounting was closed, strange they can still charge to your card should they miss something. Then called the following day to be challenged that I had - vehicles, then told it would be - days before they could review and correct the issue if they found it. Asked for the manager, person answred as the manager, was the controller????????? Discussed the bill and she said she would investigate. In the mean time thought about it and remembered we did drive in with another couple, but they are still there, so called the hotel and asked for the manager by name, that is how I found out I never made it to the manager. At that time I was told I had a gold whatever. I have a red Titan. Called the other couple we went with who was still checked in and she went to the front desk in an attempt to clear things up. Now I'm concernned because we had many meals at the restaurant and pool and drinks in the bar that I signed for. What else did I buy, that wasn't mine????? Not going back",not happy
"I stayed here for a business trip and was so pleased by the comfort and great service. Whoever hired the staff should be very pleased with the team. The accomodations, fitness center, complimentary breakfast, and personal service made this trip pleasant for me. I did not use the shuttle, laundry, pool, or whirlpool as I was quite busy every day. If you have to be away from home on business you want to stay somewhere like this. I recommend it.",happy

"For starters I would never stay at this hotel ever again. We went to check in Friday afternoon at -PM and didn't end up getting a room until --PM that night. They kept giving a handful of customers the excuse that the rooms aren't ready yet and needed to be cleaned and the cleaning staff went home for the night. This is after -PM at night!!!! What have these people been doing all day????????? We were suppose to get - rooms with - doubles beds in each but they only gave us - rooms with - king bed in each. We had to sleep three people to a bed....tons of fun let me tell you! The bathroom was the size of a small closet and the toliet seat had dried paint and glue stains all over it, not to mention the mold in the shower. A receptionist by the name of Kathy was probably the rudest women I have ever met. She looks like a sweet grandma but don't let that fool you. She turned her back and walked into the back office area three times while I was talking to her trying to get our rooms straightened out. The - dozen or so people waiting in the lobby were all irrate at the horrible service and [--] these people were trying to feed us. I have honestly never seen something like this in my life! I can understand your - disgrunted customer, but not - dozen all at the same time. I was waiting for a fight to break out there was so much yelling and frustration in that place.

"I had an awful time at this hotel. The Valet dropped my key in the street and almost lost it , I found it and the parking is -- dollars per night and there is no self parking. The spa was terrible, I booked my trip with the spa manager and it was poorly planned for by the manager, The massage therapist called in sick on one of my friends treatments and they called my home phone to let us know she could get a facial instead. an hour and a half before the treatment ( We never got the call since we had a - hour drive to san diego and we were already at the hotel . They did not offer discount or anything for the inconvenience until we complained to a manager I was handed toilet paper to put in the bathroom myself. We had to use the mens locker room because there wasn't enough room in the women's locker room. The treatments were less than mediocre for the price that it is I expected more! The pool was newly renovated and we were promised that it would be open and it was closed for - hours which was during the time period that we were able to use it cause we had our spa treatments when it was supposed to open.Then the security at the club was extremely rude and lied about his name when we asked him. We paid money to stay in a very nice hotel and expected to be treated a whole lot better than we were. When we called a manager to complain about the security we were told that there are - sides to the story and given a complimentary drink to solve the problem and my friend was stating that this is the worst hotel she's ever stayed at and another lady walking by said I agree.The staff was unfriendly with the exception of the bell service. The worst part is after the whole experience I complained to the manager and all he could do is send me a form letter and offer an upgrade if I choose to return. When I complained about the form letter all he can say is sorry you feel that way. Talk about poor customer service! I will make it my goal to let everyone know that this was The Worst Hotel I've Ever stayed at and worst customer service I have ever had.",not happy

Also a Magnolia Bakery and Juniors is downstairs! Love their cheesecake! It was a perfect mini vacation!",happy

"Why I'm rating this hotel as one star is not that it truly deserves one star. It's to make up for all the people that mistakenly have given it such good reviews. The truth is that it's a two star motel with pretensions of being a three star motel but with some serious one star failings. My feeling is that at a three star motel you should feel safe and comfortable. The rooms were noisy. The second floor rooms shook as people walked by outside because of a walkway with a cantilevered design. The heating units were of an older type which means they were hard to control and noisy too boot. The beds were too high (sitting on the bed my feet did not touch the floor) and too soft. Now, as far as safety was concerned, I have some serious doubts about gas stoves in a motel. In addition the location of the motel was in a slightly dicey neighborhood.
Note, this motel is not very conveniently located if you are a tourist and there are also not all that many good places to eat nearby. The exception is the small Lebanese restaurant directly across the street which is quite authentic and worth a visit.",not happy
"There's a lot of positive things about this place.
 First is location -- it's extremely convenient to the airport and most of the attractions as well. There is also a Trader Joes and Vons within less than a half mile -- almost walking distance. The location on the esplanade park and walkway is wonderful, with bayfront-estuary views and a huge walking-biking pathway right outside the door and a huge park there too. Its in a quiet safe neighborhood with the only sound disturbances being the planes taking off, because of the proximity to the airport. 
 The rooms have a nice almost full kitchen -- full size fridge, dishwasher, microwave, - burner range and no oven. There is a nice large granite type counter area that is very convenient for food preparation and a small dining table with - chairs in our one bedroom unit. There's a nice little balcony with one chair on it -- for a little reading or coffee in the sunshine. There are two LG flatscreen TVs -- one in the living room and one in the bedroom that are quite adequate. The fold out couch in the living room is smallish and the cushions are showing some age related compression, but it was still comfortable. There's a worktable with ergonomic chair and easy web access stuff and outlets that are efficient and comfortable. The bed linens are soft and comfortable, there are a wide variety of pillows available. The toilet paper is Cottonelle -- so it's nice and soft, not the single ply sandpaper stuff that many places are trying to offer now, and the toiletries are very nice Neutrogena products. 
 The business center computers are antiquated and slow and pretty much only useful for printing out boarding passes. The laundry is large and bright with plenty of machines that are modern and do a good job. My husband enjoyed the exercise equipment that included a treadmill, elliptical, stationary bike, free weights and a weight machine - drinking fountains and a TV were available in the workout room. 
The gardens and outdoor areas were extensive, well landscaped and maintained.. There was quite a variety of outdoor seating available, with many areas having gas fireplaces in the seating areas. There were several outdoor grills available for guest use that were modern, clean and ready to go. 
The breakfast and dinner offerings are adequate - but not gourmet. You get hot filling food, but it's just kind of average. Standard make your own waffles, bagels, english muffins, etc, - three """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hot offerings"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" which usually are eggs, sausage and tater tots -- the best of which is the tater tots, and a fruit and yogurt bar that has canned peaches, canned mandarins, cottage cheese and yogurt, and some fresh melon chunks. Evening offerings are a nice enough salad bar, and a hot offering that has been during our stay - edible, but mostly because it's included. There's drinkable wine and beer and with the nice pool table and fireplace area, it offers a nice opportunity to unwind after the day. 
I found the staff to be friendly and responsive, even when our flight was delayed. The cleaning staff is polite, unobtrusive and efficient.
The hotel offers very good rates, with nice discounts for government and AAA and they participate in the HH points program. It is a family oriented hotel, so there will be kids at breakfast, in the pool, etc.... and, of course, their behavior is up to their parents ... but we had no problem with noise. 
Overall - the best place to stay in SanDiego if you're not looking for night life, excitement etc. If you want a great convenient location, nice facilities, large room, kitchen facilities, and the open air experience -- with just a few minutes to the zoo, SeaWorld, Balboa park, airport and downtown -- no parking fees, no internet fees, and a safe place where you and your kids can stretch out and run around.... This one's got it!!!",happy
"We just returned from a - night stay (Oct. ---) and I cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel. The entire staff is friendly, helpful and goes out of their way to make your stay delightful. Rick's Lounge is amazing. This is one of the few places where a continental breakfast includes hard boiled eggs ( a great item if you are watching your carbs). The coffees and snacks throughout the day and evening are a wonderful way to recharge after a busy schedule. However, the evening wine and cheese reception cannot be beat. It was so nice to relax and sip some sparkling wine before heading out to face the chaos of Times Square. Our room was a nice size (- double beds) but some of the rooms did look extremely small. The bathroom is beautiful and is so clean it sparkles. The entire hotel was extremely quiet, we never heard any street noise. The restaurant recommendations were perfect.

"There is a sign posted by the door of the Wit that says something to the effect of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""more an experience than a hotel"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". After staying here for one night, while attending a wedding onsite, I'll have to say I think management should focus more on being a hotel and less on being an experience.
The positive things about the hotel are evident from the website. The rooms are unique, the modern decoration is attractive, and the location is fantastic. I attended a wedding reception, which used the roof bar for cocktail hour, and the views are simply amazing. It's a very hip, fun place to hang out.
But, I really can't recommend spending your money to sleep here. To start, there was a parade going on downtown, and we could not navigate the streets to get to the hotel. We called the front desk to ask for directions, and for help on where to park since the parking entrance was blocked by the parade. The front desk literally knew nothing. Despite the fact that the parade was marching by their front door, no one had any information about the route, or timing, or how to park at the hotel during this time. We finally had a friend drop us about a half mile from the hotel, and we walked over to discuss in person how he could drive up. They acted just as clueless in person as they had on the phone. Friend ended up parking elsewhere and walking over.
Second, after the wedding reception ended, the bride invited the group to the rooftop bar to continue the party. What we were not told, by hotel management, is that after a certain hour only one elevator takes you to the roof, so we would have to go downstairs, go outside, wait in line, get a wrist band, then take the elevator back upstairs. Not realizing this, myself and a few others went in to the stairwell from the floor we were on for dinner to walk up to the roof. There was a bouncer at the door who would not let us in, which is annoying to begin with, but that alone wouldn't make me complain. However what was simply unbelievable is that he would not escort us to the elevator to let us out, and instead left us LOCKED in the stairwell on the top floor! None of the doors on other floors opened, until the ground floor. And, I was wearing heels. He would not call anyone to come let us in, even after we begged and explained that we were hotel guests trying to get to our room, he simply told us we had to leave and walk all the way down. We started banging on the doors at each floor, and a hotel patron heard us and opened from the inside and let us in. Needless to say I did not bother trying to get back to the club.
Back in our room, which was on a middle floor, closer to the top than bottom, to add insult to inury we could hear the music from the club while we tried to sleep! My friend was on a floor above us and said it was so loud she couldn't sleep at all. It wasn't awful where I was, but definitely you could still hear it.
So, overall, this is a nice place to visit, but service is lacking, and for most people it's not the best place to rest your head. Look elsewhere to spend your dollars.",not happy
"We booked this hotel through Expedia.ca as part of a fly-stay package. Never having stayed in NYC before, I really had no expectations. I had read that the hotel was older and maybe needed a face lift. That's maybe true, but the rooms were clean, the beds comfortable and as I always travel with earplugs, I wasn't bothered by traffic noise or other guests. True, the room wasn't overly large, but I'm not in NYC to spend time in my room! The hotel is definitely within walking distance of some great sightseeing spots (Times Square, -th Avenue, Central Park and Grand Central were all an easy walk, even for my -- year old mother-in-law). And it was a pleasant surprise to wake up Sunday morning and find Lexington Avenue closed to traffic in front of the hotel for a vendor's market that stretched for blocks. I'd give a special shout out to Craig, the concierge, who was able to obtain fantastic tickets for us to see Zarkana at Radio City Music Hall (I would have gone -- more times!) and to Jimmy the doorman for recommending a wonderful pizza restaurant within walking distance of the hotel which didn't break the budget! It might not be the biggest, brightest, newest hotel in NYC, but I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again.",happy

We took our rental car back to the airport and were promplby picked up by the hotel shuttle service by a friendly driver. After settling in, we found to our delight that the hotel offered a light supper with free wine or beer. This was a pleasant surprise since we were exhausted after our trip from SD & unsure as to where we could grab a quick bite to eat.

"We booked two queens non-refundable via Expedia for a two night stay. We were two couples and a baby. When we checked in, we were told we would be upgraded to a suite, but only had one queen in the room with a sofa bed. By """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""suite"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", they meant a separate kitchen with a faulty light that flashed incessantly and two microwaves. The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sofa bed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" was not even made and we were not provided sheets. Not to mention, it was hardly the size of a single bed, so how the hotel expected two adults to sleep in it is beyond me. When we complained we were told because we booked via Expedia, our room type was not guaranteed, and seeing as they were fully booked and had had some recent water damage to some of the rooms (bla bla bla) there was nothing that could be done. But they did provide us with - cots which were more comfortable (and larger) than the sofa bed. The cots had sheets, but no comforters. The queen bed also did not have a comforter (just sheets). When we requested comforters, we were told there weren't any left, but were kindly provided - additional sheets!!! Furthermore, the queen bed was as hard as the floor. At that point, we wanted our money back to go stay in another hotel, but we were told by front desk staff there was no manager until Monday morning, conveniently the day we were checking out, so again - no refund was possible. The next morning we spoke to Claudia at the front desk (honestly, the best thing about this hotel - they are lucky to have her). Claudia provided us with another room with - queens (which apparently was not available the night before, even though we were able to change rooms at -:--am before housekeeping had started) and comforters. She also comped breakfast (mediocre) and drinks at the bar. There were other guests complaining of the same situation as we were the next morning, and they also had booked with Expedia. 
My husband and I stayed at this hotel August ---- and were satisfied the first time, enough to return. Unfortunately, the last stay left a sour taste in our mouths so we won't be back a third time.

"Having never been to San Antonio previously I really didn't know what to expect from the Crockett, but I was pleased with my choice. The clerk at check-in was very cheerful and helpful, as was nearly all the staff I met. The clerk at check out was less cheerful, but then it was way too early an hour for me too! The location, right across from the Alamo is great for exploring the downtown area. Cost was very reasonable for the location, considerably less than some other hotels in the area. The room, while certainly less palatial than some others, was certainly large enough for my needs. The included breakfast was very good with eggs, fruit, cereal, waffles, yogurt, toast, pastries, etc. My only minor complaint was that the phone was not working, something I didn't discover until I didn't get my wake-up call on my final morning of my four day stay. Luckily I'd also used the radio alarm, which worked just fine.",happy

At the Barclay: We arrived early and knew our room would not be ready, but tried. I had emailed in advance and told the Guest Services it was a special occasion. To our delight, we were upgraded to a Designer Suite. We checked our bags ($-) each and did some touring of NYC.
The Room: Wow, the wait was worth it. We had a HUGE Bedroom and Sitting Room. The furniture is ultra modern, Bose Radio in the bedroom, Large TV, Refrigerator, and a well-stocked mini-bar. Check the prices first. We walked across the street and had two great Deli's to choose from, everything from A-Z.
The bed, wow, what a super night's sleep! We turned the fan on and used the 'white noise' to drown out the crazy horn-honking of NYC drivers. You will love the comfortable beds and the great pillows.
The staff even does turn down service and does a light make-over, replacing towels, and making the room ready for your return from an evening out. The chocalates are yummy! Of course check out the in-room breakfast choices. A Regular juice, eggs, toast, meat, and coffee is $--. There are too many options within walking distance, unless, of course you have a ton of cash.
Staff-Check-in was a great experience, many people there to help you out. Melissa was awesome! Everyone was friendly. House Security quickly found a bag my wife left in the lobby, after a frantic walk from downtown. Only one Bellman was not friendly, the rest went out of their way to help us. Concierege Staff is knowledgeable and mosthelpful.
Location: Just around the corner is an underground walkway to Grand Central Terminal. You take the Northwest Passage way next to the trains and you are --- feet from the hotel entrance. We walked from Broadway and Times Square a lot, sometimes skipping the convenent """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""S"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Train from Times Square to Grand Central. The Barclay is a convenient and excellent location. One day we had to rush to meet some friends at the Empire State Building. Taxi fare was $-.--. So, if you are in a hurry, taxis are a great value to make that curtain time. 
Ambience: Beautiful flowers at the entrance and a HUGE live flower ordains the lobby. Comfortable and stylish furniture make the lobby a great place to wait or 'people watch'. The atmosphere is upscale but not pretentious. Everything from jeans to designer suits were being worn.
If you want a super clean, upscale, larger than normal rooms,. Make the Barclay your place to stay!",happy
"recently took - boys there to watch a Lion's football game. the location of this hotel was hard to beat, right downtown, with people-mover access just a - min. walk from the door. valet parked the car and never needed it again until we left a couple days later. the exercise room is fantastic, very high end equipment. would have enjoyed a pool, sauna and-or hot tub perhaps. but that was one of the few items lacking. suite was quiet and clean, beds-linens were very comfortable. we did not eat in, but there are options for dining as well as a nice lounge right in the hotel. we opted for some other local eateries, just a people-mover ride away.",happy
"We had a good experience during our weekend stay and chose this location because we were traveling by car back and forth to --th Street and this was a hassle free route.
Our room was dbl-dbl with kitchenette,adequate for our needs and I appreciated the eco-friendly aspects to the hotel.Hotel staff was friendly,esp.Bernadette who was most helpful on arrival.

Have the social hour with free wine (and nice wine!), the Cafe serves wonderful food, very fresh and unique (asparagus salad was fantastic, great hummus and pita bread). Staff are very courteous, responded quickly to any questions or concerns. Discovered only - negative - no sleep timer on the TV remote for those of us who like to fall asleep to the TV.",happy
"Historically interesting for its art moderne architecture and legacy as a former bank office tower (one of the first towers ever to be air conditioned), the lobby and public areas of the hotel have been restored nicely to capture the time of original construction. Good location, easy walk to Reading Terminal and its shops-eat places across the street, as well as walking distance to Independence Mall and Rittenhouse Square. There is a nice lap pool with good views, as well as full gym and steam-sauna--all pluses.
On down side, air conditioning didn't work. We had to change rooms after a service technician came up three times to fix it, and it never got cool enough and also had a bit of a funky smell. We were on the two floors that allow dogs, so if you have a dog this hotel is a good choice. We had a small dog--challenge to find nearby grassy spots btw when you walk dog.",happy
"We found this in one of the brochures you can get all over the place in the US which advertise discounts at many hotels and motels. We were looking for a couple of nights for a family of - to see the sites - Alcatraz, Cable Cars and the shopping. We picked the motel due to it's close location to many of the popular tourist areas in San Francisco, and nearby access to public transport. There is inclusive parking which many hotels charge extra for, and whilst it isn't a - star property, the rooms were large and clean with refrigerator, microwave and flat screen TV. The guy on reception was very helpful and told us of the quickest way to get to the many attractions - fisherman's wharf, the shopping areas of Union Square and Westfield, the bridge and suchlike. He also advised of areas (or actually the area) to steer clear of - Tenderloin, but everywhere else was safe and no problems were encountered. We also got a good deal on the room rate which as it was a weekend was higher than on the weekdays. We got a good breakfast from Pete's Diner next door - the blueberry pancakes were great - and the staff very friendly. There was a little bit of noise at night, but this is in a central area. All in all a good deal and would recommend.",not happy
"Full disclosure: I am a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""gold"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" level cardholder with Marriott so my experience may differ from the other reviews which aren't so hot. My city view room was spotless. Checking in was speedy as was checking out. If you have access to the concierge lounge, the outdoor patio is great to relax on. The location is ideal as it's close to the airport, convention center and the art museum. Across the street is Il Fornaio restaurant-very good for lunch-dinner.",happy
"We stayed here - nights in Dec. ---- as part of a company Xmas party. We had a room in Tower - which was quite small and had only a shower (no tub). The only thing I really liked was that you could park on the same floor as your room. Others in our party had rooms in Tower - which seemed much newer and larger - the person who booked the party was given a corner suite room on the --nd floor which had a great view and very large bedroom with a balcony. 
Our lowly --th floor room looked over at the enclosed swimming pool at another hotel. When my friend checked in, we asked for a room on the --th floor near the pool and this was nicer as you could open a door to a small sitting area. The --th floor also had a bridge to Tower -, which was much easier than going down to the lobby in one elevator and back up the next. The --th floor was one big rectangal and we were quite far from the elevator! We only paid $-- per night - so you get what you pay for.
We had a good breakfast across the street at the small Taylor Street Cafe (or something similar) and used the hot tub & pool (both heated in Dec.) - a nice quiet respite from the noisy City. The hours were odd - open very early and closed early (-:-- AM to - PM). 
The meal for our party was not particularly good and the waiters were very grabby with the wine glasses (taking them away before we were done). We had a great bartender though - Raoul.
Was an easy walk to Union Square and the Westfield center on Market Street. There were some homeless around as is typical of the City.
Personally, I enjoyed the St. Francis hotel better as the beds were much more comfortable and rooms were more modern and larger!!",not happy

"The Kimberly Suites Hotel was a great experience. The staff are so friendly and service minded, especially the doormen and the Penthouse Lounge waiters. The Penthouse lounge (--th floor) is a great place for breakfast or drinks in the evening. The view with the big windows and the lit up Chrysler building and comfortable chairs are great. We got upgraded to a suite and the furniture, antique style, makes you feel like you are in Rome. Two bath-rooms with rain shower faucets and great towels. Comfortable bed, two TVs, and quiet and nice. What a way to start sightseeing in NY, Manhattan. The location could not be better. A bit a way from the noisy and messy Times Square, but surely within close walking distance. Fifth avenue and all shopping on Madison is so close by. Lexington and around the --th have so many restaurants. The -- hour breakfast next to the hotel is a great Manhattan experience with good breakfast food and very fast service. The National restaurant down the street is a great fine dining restaurant. And the hotel offers daily passes to the NY Health and Racquet Club, if you feel the hotel workout area is too small. A few blocks away and close to Saks on Fifth.
Pricey, yes everything is on Manhattan. Value considering Manhattan-clearly worth the extra money!",happy
"Spent a few days here while my partner attended a medical conference. Great staff, had trouble with the heater in my room and someone was sent up immediately. Great concierge and doormen as mentioned by other reviewers. Was not crazy about the bar-lounge-dining area, that could be reworked. Easily accessible to shopping and it is a stop for the tourist trolley which is a plus. Love, love, love the pool, jacuzzi, gym on the -th floor. Would stay here again for that experience......",happy
"The hotel has - elevators. Only - were working at time we were staying at hotel. We literally waited no less than -- minutes EVERY SINGLE TIME we left our room. We tried to take the stairs, but there was liquid all over the steps and it smelled like beer.
The hotel is quite expensive for what you get in the room. Rooms are on the smaller side. Bathroom was dirty. Had to pay up the ying yang for local calls and internet. $-- to park car-per day. $-- for valet.
It was sorority-fraternity conference week the weekend we tried to stay there. Literally ----+ -- year olds running around like a bunch of idiots. NO security presence whatsoever. Had to call the front desk --- times. It was horrible!

"My husband and I stayed at the Fairmont for Labor Day weekend for our first visit to Chicago. We got a ridulously affordable rate including breakfast every day, the only catch it was non refundable. I would suggest joining the Fairmont's presidents club, which is what we did and got free use of the gym, free internet daily and free late -pm check out. The rooms were large, the beds comfortable. The only complaint we had was the shower, terrible water pressure. The hotel was clean, the staff helpful. Great location, a bit off Michigan Avenue so its quiet. When we go visit chicago again I would not stay anywhere else. Ask for the presidents club rate including breakfast and join the presidents club, its free!",happy
"We loved this hotel is the close to everything we wanted to see and a short walk from the subway station. My kids loved the train that goes under the hotel, it was an added attraction at no cost.

"The BEST valets anywhere! This is the best hotel at which I've stayed in Houston. It is private, quiet, well appointed and usually the staff are EXTREMELY nice and accommodating. I've never made the evening reception the several times I've stayed here, but I assume it's a nice treat. The cookies and milk at bedtime are great. The biggest complaint is you have to go to the lounge for wi-fi. A bit pricey, but it hasn't kept me from staying there on several occasions.",happy

"Don't let the road where the hotel is based put you off, it doesn't look that nice, but it's absolutely fine and the central location is fantastic.
We were allowed to check in early. The room was spotless, spacious and everything was brand new.
There was a little noise, but you are a fool if you think that it will be silent anywhere in NY.
Breakfast was fantastic, and served until --am, not -am. It was the only hotel that I found that offered breakfast free of charge. And the price was great, $--- for two people per night. That's not expensive for NY.
Staff were friendly, would do anything to help. When we checked out we asked if we could leave our bags there for the day. There was absolutely no problem, and they didn't charge us for doing it.
Overall, it was a great hotel at a great price. It's not luxurious, but it's everything else!",happy
"Just returned from a six day trip to San Antonio, TX. and while there we stayed at the JW Marriott Resrt & Spa. The property is amazing. For families they have an on site water park complete with slides, lazy river pool, cabanna's etc. The rooms were very nice and there were a few restaurants on site. 
We had an opportunity to eat at the Steak House, -- Oaks which is loctaed on the golf course and it was exceptional. It is somewhat pricey but worth every penny. They also have a large sports bar-restaurant with numerous beers on tap and decent bar food. Another on site restaurant is the Cibolo Moon which is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and we ate there on a few occassions and must say it was also very good. I also thought the prices were fair for the type of property the resort is. 
The only draw back to staying at this property is that you need a car as there is nothing within walking distance so therefore yo have to drive. To take a cab into san Antonio too see the Riverwalk or the Alamo it is a SIXTY DOLLAR cab fare one way. The hotel does not have a shuttle and I do not think that they are planning on getting one as they want you to stay and spend your money at the resort. With that being said I would not hesitate to go back.
It is also of note that all the staff are great and go out of their way to make you feel very special.",happy
"Just stayed at the Whitehall Hotel in August ---- for the third time and found it better than ever. I was very surprised to read the recent reviews posted for this hotel. The first time I stayed here in ---- they were in the process of renovating their rooms. The room we had then was nice and clean. I assumed by now all their rooms had been renovated but maybe not from the sound of some of these reviews. I stayed at the Whitehall in December ---- and found the hotel again quite nice for the price and a great location for shopping and dining in the snow. It is across the street from the Four Seasons, a half block from the John Hancock Building on Michigan Avenue, one block from Watertown Mall and just a couple of blocks from great restaurants on Rush Street. 
We found the staff very friendly and accommodating. Furnished us with umbrellas, great restaurant recommendations and directions. The elevators are small but we didn't find that to be a problem. My husband and I fit in it with a large suitcase and a rolling golf bag. Capacity on the elevator is limited to -. I guess we were just never in a hurry.

"Nine Zero is well placed for exploring Boston. We only used the transit once to visit Harvard, otherwise we walked everywhere. You can step right out of the front door and onto the Freedom Trail and if you need a subway it's just a block away. Rooms are stylish with spacious, well appointed bathrooms and comfortable beds. There is a pleasing ambiance throughout the hotel and we found the early evening wine reception a fun way to start the evening and exchange stories with fellow guests. Staff were courteous, friendly and professional and happy to make our stay as comfortable as possible. A boutique hotel might not seem an obvious choice with two teenage boys but we all appreciated the hotel for different reasons.",happy
"I've stayed in at least a dozen hotels in San Francisco within walking distance of the Palomar. Most cost a little less. For me, the slightly higher rate for the Palomar was worth it. 
It's not a true luxury hotel, so don't go there expecting something extraordinary; if you're content with a basic, comfortable room, you can find many at a lower rate. But at the Palomar, my room was definitely larger than average. Although I don't spend a lot of time in my hotel rooms, over a period of several days a small room can feel cramped. The bed was fine, the decor was understated and classy. Everything was clean. Flat screen TV with DVD player, mp--player clock radio, mini bar, bathrobes and umbrella in the closet along with an iron, selection of good newspapers. The bathroom was average--nothing remarkable, but no problems with the shower or anything else (not always the case in my experience; sometimes showers are cramped, or the shower head is too low, or the water turns hot and cold by itself). I was on the seventh floor, and although the windows were covered by plate plexiglass, which dampened exterior noise from the busy street below, I could hear an occasional honk or dumpster routine in the middle of the night. But it was relatively quiet; I've been to many hotels in the area at which dumpsters being emptied in the middle of the night have made sleep impossible; not so here. It has a free wine hour in the evening.
The location--around the corner from Market Street--is a matter of personal preference. It's a short walk to Union Square, but there are many hotels a few blocks closer. I always use the BART, so I liked having the station a minute from the hotel, instead of ten minutes.
I was particularly impressed by the service. Each and every one of the people I dealt with at the front desk was extremely helpful as well as friendly. I got a good recommendation for a breakfast place nearby, and the staff person called to make sure it was serving before I walked over. I had a problem with my check at the hotel bar (under separate management) and the hotel took care of it without any hassle at all. I The doorman always wished me a nice day and asked if I wanted transportation, but he was never pushy. The room was cleaned unobtrusively. These are all things we should expect, but just don't always happen, so when everything works, I think it's worth mentioning.
A few details: The hotel is pet friendly. If you're a Klimpton member, wi-fi is free. The lobby is small, so you won't want to sit in it a read a newspaper or hang out.",happy

"The Wardman Park Marriott is an attractive, conveniently located hotel that seems to serve a variety of styles of traveler. You can't beat the access to the metro and little local shops. The hotel amenities, particularly the little room refrigerator, are extremely useful. However, the room walls are thin, and if you are a light sleeper you will not sleep well.

When we eventually did locate our room, the key would not work, nor would the janitor's.

"First, it is NOT near Union Station. It's a -- minute walk to Union Station, according to Google Maps. I didn't even try it. I was expecting I would be able to do all my journeys by subway, but that made it impossible. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood, so I decided to do everything by cab, but that was bad too. Every time the reception staff called a cab for me, it would not be a legally registered cab with taximeter. It was a guy with his personal car charging flat rates. My room itself was reasonable, the only problem was a mild cigarette odor in the carpet. What is really terrible, actually, is the bad neighborhood where the hotel is. One morning when I was there, five days ago, one of the guests had his car window broken and some of his stuff was stolen during the night. The only reason I don't vote for the lowest rate here is that the hotel staff seems to be kind and willing to help. But that doesn't make much of a difference.",not happy
"Check-in was smooth though early check-in was not possible this Saturday morning. Room was available promptly at - pm.
Had a wonderful lunch at the rooftop bar; service a little slow but food tasty, if a little ill presented for the windy rooftop conditions (salad lettuce blowing everywhere.) couch-like loungers very cozy for two or more, loved the Astroturf, outdoor fireplace a nice touch as well. Nice to be able to eat outside in December but this is a place beckoning for summer evening drinks.
We got a gigantic room (corner) on the -th floor. (staff told us that the floor right beneath the rooftop pool can be rather loud at night and suggested that if we minded that to stay on a lower floor) room was decorated nicely, appropriate to the rest of the hotel’s aesthetic (white, yellow, grey). While it was indeed gigantic for a city hotel, the room’s walls felt rather stark for the size. Linens were clean and adequate the bed was mediocre. Everything appeared clean but the interior side of the shower curtain had - different types of hair on it before either of us got in and a remnant of unused soap remained on the sunken tub’s ledge. Shower pressure stunk. Entire hotel smells like smoke – even our “non-smoking” room and hallways – but this is a party hotel the place smells like beer, sex and cigarettes because that’s what a lot of their customers are there for. We were there on the day of the UCLA-USC game and a few rooms down from us was some kind of afternoon party that was loud and drunk. Who cares - they were just having a good time. Lots of mid-twenties guests this day.
We ate dinner at the restaurant. Food was alright, described better than it turned out to be. Bread was tasty and warmed as was the calamari. Vibe was very upscale, hipster diner-ish; though cheekily designed and low-light. Menu was different than what is online. Service was indifferent; pushy and hurried though only was at half capacity. I asked for two items from the lunch menu (I’m pregnant and had my heart set on the onion soup and onion-goat cheese tart!) and was told by the waiter, who didn't even bother to check with the chefs, that the request couldn’t be accommodated even though those items were available for dinner through room service. (Is this is a shared kitchen?) Waiter seemed to feel his only job was to deliver food not a decent experience. As we were leaving, we said something about the ridiculous amount of coffee grains in our coffee, even showing the guy and as he walked away he said “well, that’s what happens when it’s made fresh.” (?)
We pre-ordered our breakfast the night before; it was delivered exactly on time, hot and served with a smile. The prices on the breakfast struck us as unusually low for a hotel, ditto the meager service charge of $-.--. (e.g. – French toast at $- and - Eggs, home fries or salad, - pieces of bacon (of ham, sausage), toast of your choosing, juice, and a pot of coffee-tea filled with - full cups all for $--!) They forgo the maple syrup and remedied it within - minutes of our calling to request it.
We requested a late check-out an hour before we were supposed to depart with no problem. (They moved it to - pm.) 
Check-out went smooth and valet was quick to get our car.
By and large, it was exactly what we expected. Great front desk service, sexy and thoughtfully designed room, mixed bag of food, and downtown LA. (Agreeably, much less pretension than the Standard on Sunset.)",not happy

I was late for dinner reservations so quickly dropped my things off and went to dinner. Later that night I returned to the room and upon further inspection found the following problems - a hold in the wall in the bathroom, a significant tear in the rug by the bed, an unsightly area around the heating-air conditioning unit, and really, in general, just an awful room. Given the late hour I had neither the patience nor the energy to head down to the front desk to complain and figured I'd discuss the problems at check out in the morning. Wow, was I wrong. At check out I explained that I have stayed at Starwood properties for over --- nights this year and that I was wondering if there was any sort of discount or points allotment that I could receive for my less than spectacular room. I was told by the front desk attendant that there was nothing that could be done. I find this appalling.

When we chose XV Beacon, we had no prior knowledge of the hotel other than looking at its website and review on Tripadvisor and booking.com. We arrived Christmas Eve, the night before the blizzard and you would think that anyone working Christmas Eve would want to do anything but be at work, let alone during a blizzard. This couldn't be further from the truth at XV Beacon. The staff was amazingly attentive, friendly and helpful without being overbearing. During the night of the blizzard, the only restaurant open was the hotel's (Mooo) which happens to be an amazing steak place in its own right. The hotel's room service is also served by Mooo, so we decided to have a great steak in our room, snow and wind blowing outside in front of the fireplace in our room...what could be better. From the bell staff, front desk, concierge and cleaning staff...you simply don't find service like this in most hotels, let alone more expensive ones.

The kids love the Select Guest """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""morning drinks"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" that the Omni offers, too. The Omni is a bit out of town; the first day we drove in, the second we took the Metro, which seems a better bet to me.",happy
"I recently stayed at this Kimpton property while on business in DC. From the time I walked in I knew it was going to be an amazing experience and stay. The staff are all very courteous and outgoing. They will do anything to make your stay the best ever. Customer service is vitally important in my decision for repeat stays and the staff at Palomar won me over. The lobby is very clean and welcoming with its hip decor and music. There is a great manager's wine reception every evening that is a superb networking time and social frenzy. I had a HUGE room overlooking the street. The rooms are decorated with a nice minimalist touch. The bed and linens like most Kimpton properties are soft and a perfect end to a busy day. You couldn't ask for a cooler location. The hotel is right in the heart of Dupont Circle with lots of fun pubs and diverse cuisine close by. It is very convenient to the metro and just a few stops from the monuments. Overall, I had an amazing stay and plan to make Palomar one of my top hotel choices as I am frequently in DC.",happy

"My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Donatello and we can't say enough nice things about it. It was our first time to San Francisco and we booked the resort through Shell Vacations Club. (We are members.) The hotel is centrally located within walking distance of Union Square and Chinatown and within a -- minute driving distance of Lombard Street, the Wharf and the Golden Gate Bridge. The room and the hotel were lovely. The room was tastefully decorated with nice colors and a number of windows, a large bed and a pullout couch. There was also a mini-kitchen in the room, with a microwave, small refridge, a sink, plates, cups and utinsels. The hotel staff was exceptional, - the valet, the concierge, the front desk employees, the cleaning crew, EVERYONE - were extremely nice and very helpful. I would recommend this hotel-resort to my family and friends. It was a wonderful experience.",happy
"Just returned from a - day business trip and stayed at the Westin Riverwalk. First of all San Antonio is just magical at this time of the year. the city goes all out with the holidays lights, christmas carolers on the barges, serenading at those eating outside along the way. I really enjoyed my stay this trip. 
The hotel is one of the nicer Westins! Rooms were clean, spacious, modern. Hotel was perfectly situated on the Riverwalk. The Restaurant Zocco has really great food, super service and a fantastic bartender, Jo-Jo - who always made me feel comfortable as the solo female business traveler. (He makes a mean Brandy Alexander by the way). The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The Westin Work out had about - treadmills, two elliptical cross trainers, one stationary bike, several weight machines and a small areas for stretching and dumbells. Not bad. The pool was small, but seemed to be nice. 
All in all, i would most certainly stay at this hotel again - hands down.",happy
"We spent - nights here and this was our second stay in the past two years. As a tourist we find the location to be super and the main reason we chose the Mayflower. We took light rail from the airport to the end (Westlake Center) and walked to the hotel lobby from a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Hotel Entrance"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" hall in the Center. Couldn't be more convenient. It would be better if every day they didn't have the entrance blocked off in the hotel due to special functions.
The rooms have everything one could want except for a small refrigerator. We take a Queen (only size beds here) Deluxe and highly recommend room ---- - it has pocket doors separating the bedroom from the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""living room"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".
We really like the restaurant and the cocktail lounge and ate breakfast and dinner in one or the other. The locals fill them up so it must be popular.",happy
"This hotel looks good from the website and the lobby is clean but thats where it stops. the rest of the hotel is dirty, everywhere you walk its sticky and nasty.metal stairs are rusted thru - in our room there was black mold on the walls and in the bathroom ( which is not spacious as in the website info). Lukewarm water for the shower in the morning was the norm. The toilet had not been cleaned and the hotel had no security that walked the hotel.
The hotel maintenance man was very good and replaced the whole ac unit for us.

"Although we arived at the hotel at -:-- AM, we were able to check in for both our rooms. The front desk staff was extremely accomodating. The rooms were clean, well appointed and large for a city hotel. The beds were very comfortable. The rooms were quiet. The hotel was in easy walking distance of the cable cars, BART, trollies and a variety of restaurants. The concierge was able to make good recommendations for locations for dinner. He also provided good driving directions when we were ready to head to Sonoma. We were able to get a great pay-in-advance room rate, so the hotel was an excellent value.",happy

"This was an unbelievably horrible experience. I checked in at --:-- pm after a long day of work. I am a silver elite member and was told that my room was upgraded. I walked into a hotel room with a gorgeous view. I went to the bathroom to find that there was water all over the floor, probably a leaky toilet. I called the front desk and told them that I would prefer another room, and was told that they are completely sold out. I don't believe that was true. I waited -- min for housekeeping to show up. No one showed up and then finally when I called again, the manager showed up. He was very nice and did make an arrangement to switch my room within - min. So there were extra rooms but the front desk was rude and inconsiderate the first time I called. I paid over $--- for this hotel room only to be bothered with poor service and inconsideration. This hotel is very large and therefore suffers with poor customer service. I expect more after paying such a high price to stay one night. They should train their front desk to determine how to deal with water on the bathroom floor. The customer should not be told that they don't have an alternative room available at that point. Especially when it's so late at night and I wanted to do was go to sleep.",not happy
"Excellant hotel in every aspect, size of room, spotless clean, modern, everything worked! Anna on reception was a star other girls nice but not as chatty

"The hotel building is older but care has been taken to update the lobby in a more interesting style. The furniture in the rooms is still old but the mattresses and linens are new and comfortable and the room was very clean. I was given a room with a nice view of the Capitol. My biggest complaint and one that would keep me from staying there again is that there is nothing of interest near the hotel. It's not far from Capitol Hill at all and you can walk there in -- minutes but the highway does a great job in cutting the whole neighborhood off from the rest of the city. There are no restaurants or convenience stores nearby except a McDonald's. The Navy Yard Metro was about a -- minute walk away but I would not feel comfortable walking there after dark. If I came back to DC, I would find another hotel that's more central but if you're ok taking cabs (I'm not) then this hotel is fine.",not happy
"Stayed here for one night in a sad looking room, with no view. The place was clean but could use a major over haul. Having a meal in the atrium is like eating in an airport. The pool is good however as is the fitness center. The staff were friendly. The location is withing walking distance of the main attractions, but it feels to be a little bit cut off from the energy of a city center hotel. There is a good grocery story in the lobby which serves great sandwitches",not happy

"Wasn’t sure how the rooms would be after reading previous reviews on here, but I was pleasantly surprised. They are modern, but not super-sleek modern. Nicely decorated, comfortable bed, etc. Some rooms have partial views of Lake Michigan.
The gym isn’t really a gym. It’s just a guest room that has been converted to an exercise space by putting gym equipment in it. Very limited weight equipment in here, but a decent selection of cardio equipment.
Perhaps the best thing about the hotel is its location. You are just blocks from the water, so during warm weather months it is easy to get the beach or along the water to exercise. Also near the hotel are the restaurants and bars of the Gold Coast. They aren’t the world’s best restaurants, but there are several restaurants full of locals for drinks and dinner, so that’s nice. In nice weather the streets around here will be packed.
You are just a few blocks from Michigan Ave, a reasonable walk from the river in decent, and not too far (though a bit of a walk) from multiple El stops.",happy
"This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The only thing good about the hotel was the price. I guess the saying that you get what you pay for holds very true for this property. The disaster started as soon as we got to our room. We were given one of the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""renovated"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" rooms, which was actually a pretty huge room with two queen beds, a chest of drawers and a TV. That was all the furniture we got. The rest of the room was obviously empty. No ice chests, no coffee, no coffee maker, no fridge, no chair or couch. Absolutely nothing. The room was horribly hot and we turned the A-C on. We very quickly discovered the air conditioner wasn't working. It took calling the front desk three times and their solution was to send a fan over. Thanks to one of the service guys who insisted that the room was too hot, we were moved to a new room. The new room was also a disaster. The air conditioner worked but the furniture was old and smelly. We were woken at - in the morning by another guest who had also been assigned our room by the front desk staff. Then we were worken again at - and - in the morning by drunk guests returning to their rooms. Breakfast was awful. Cereal and a muffin. The breakfast area smelled like urine and there was mold growing in the courtyard. They claim their pool is heated.....NOT SO. The fitness room had only ONE equipment, an elliptical. Their high speed internet was broken and wasn't scheduled to be repaired for -- hours. The whole thing was a disaster. We were scheduled to stay for - nights and we had to change hotels after one night. HORRIBLE. Not worth the money you save and there are a lot of inexpensive hotels in San Diego with better quality and service.",not happy
"Don't make the mistake and stay here unless you want awful indifferent service and outrageous charges. It starts with an additional $-- """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""resort fee"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for wi-fi service and no coffee in the room or any other place in the morning except by going into the restaurant.
I had requested a quiet room. The room in the main building was over the bar which rocked til mignight and there was an outdoor party behind my room with a loud band and firecrackers til --:-- pm. When I called the front desk they told me that I could come down and get some ear plugs. Apparently that is what they do as the clerk acted like they have to give them out all the time. The termiinal at the airport would have been a quieter and better place to sleep.
 No one in management called to apologize or provide another solution. Don't bother going here and try the Westin or Palms instead. This place is old and over rated. You will regret it.

"This was a last minute trip and the Hard Rock was picked a bit on the warily side as the best option available with the package.
We shouldn't have worried, the hotel is nice renovation, with one of the best locations in the City Center, just off the Chicago River and across the bridge to the Miracle Mile.
Check in was a piece of cake, involving a friendly upsell to a corner room with a great view. Knowing we'd be in the room so little, we opted to stay with what we had. So instead of the corner room with a view on one side, we got a gorgeous corner room with a river view! Thank you Front Desk, despite Gene Simmons licking down at you, you gave us a wonderful space for the weekend
Service was good across the board, but sometimes lacking in the conceirge department. There always seemed to be someone there when you didnt need them, but when you had a question, empty desks.
The China BAr and the Lobby Bar are both pretty much useless and expensive. Go wander elsewhere for a drink.
That said, all in all, I'd gladly come back. The room was nice and spacious, and the location made for easy access to hop elsewere on any EL line. It was a really nice stay in Chicago!",happy
"To be - blocks south of Central Park and a skip away from Times Square and -th avenue, there is nothing better for the price at this attractive and well located hotel. The suites are huge with two bathrooms, a dining and sitting area and a spacious bedroom. We went as a family of - and had more than enough room for our kids who slept on a pull out couch.
This hotel was worth the price as other compatibles would have cost several hundred of dollars more.
My only regret is that the king bed in the master suite sagged in the middle so it was not so comfortable. The bed is well dressed but the mattress needs changing. Conversely, the pull out sofa was much better than most that you find inon hotels. If the mattress had been new then it would have been a grand slam.",happy

We dined at the restaurant during our entire stay and each time the food was excellent and beautifully prepared.
The hotel staff was very responsive and hospitable and took extra effort to ensure that all of our needs were met.
The grounds are well kept, and the pool, diving pool and spa are well maintained and supervised.

"I just returned from a stay at this hotel and we enjoyed our time there. We were in the East Tower on the --th Floor with a city view. We have stayed at this hotel before and always try to request a city view room and view of the airport. This may sound strange to some people, but we actually consider it a plus that the hotel is right across the street from the airport, as we enjoy watching the planes land and take off and noise does not bother us. 
The lobby is nice, with a nautical motif and large fish tank. The one thing I found """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""funny"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is that our room decor did not seem to complement the nautical theme of the lobby. I almost felt like I was in two different hotels going from the lobby to the guest floors. The room was what I would call fairly generous in size (at least compared to some other cities).
Since the hotel was nowhere near capacity during our stay (in fact is was empty the first --- nights), the casual cafe-coffee shop was not open for breakfast. Only the main dining room was open. When a conference group came in during our -th day there, they opened all the restaurants. We really did not utilize the dining options.
For the first --- nights we were there, the main pool was closed for repairs, but the smaller pool was open until --pm. The healthclub also closes at -pm.
The hotel offers both valet and self parking. 
I would definitely plan to stay at this hotel again.",happy

Plenty of room for our family of -, with the living room and separate bedroom. We had a corner room and these are a bit bigger than other rooms. My parents were next door and were not in a corner room, so their room was a bit smaller yet still big. Our kids really enjoyed th Koi pond. One of the hotel staff gave them some food for the fish. That was very relaxing after a long day on the road. The breakfast was yummy. The lines were long, but the food was well worth it. All of the hot foods likes eggs, bacon, sausuage, french toast, pancakes, etc. were cooked to order. Check in was a breeze. We will definately stay here again when traveling to San Diego. This is one of the nicest hotels that we've stayed at.",happy

It was handy to both uptown and downtown Manhattan and there were a nice collection of shops, bars and restaurants. We walked to the ferry area and even across Brooklyn bridge from the hotel. (not a short walk though)

"The luxury pillow top beds, Egeyptian cotton sheets, soaking tubs, marble sink-vanity, separate shower, upscale bath products, challenging golf course and wonderful golf course view, superb spa and spa products all put the Ballantyne in the upper echelon of resort hotels. No complaints whatsoever with the room or its amenities!
Turn-down service did just that..turned down the bed, but didn't pick up or replace a single wet towel.
Dinner, however, was an entirely different story! The main restaurant, Traditions, seemed understaffed
...there were - waiters, and two tables seated, but both tables waited laboriously for service. We were seated by the security guard, who directed us to the restuarant when signage was inadequate, when she realized there was no one else to seat us! Service was slow, with waiters in this restaurant going to other areas to relieve workers for 'smoke' breaks, etc. The food, when served, was very over cooked and dry...Halibut and grouper done to a crisp (and not in a good way!)

Mario took care of our bags and assured our bicycles were kept locked up for us. He showed us around the hotel prior to going to our room. And made sure we knew where everything was while unloading our bags. We were helped by the front desk with dinner reservations and they promptly called our room to confirm them. 
As some have mentioned, the hotel is on the darker side of the lighting scale. But I fully expect that in a funky and hip hotel. I had no complaints at all during our stay. The staff greeted us constantly and were all helpful if we needed them. 
Upon leaving, Mario even helped get some ice for our cooler as we were driving -+ hours that day. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone!",happy

-. When checking in, i was let go with a key and a room number, only to find the key didn't work after a long walk to my room; there happened to be some housekeeping ladies down the hall, i said 'excuse me' and tried to get help from them. but they turned away. not sure if i didn't speak loud enough or they just didn't care; so i returned to the reception (again, a long walk), it turned out i wasn't checked in at all in the first place. what a shame! I was given a drink coupon, which helped a bit;
-. I checked the emergency evacuation plan on the back of the door. The floor map, the core of the plan, was barely readable! It was just too small!
-. The internet is a pain. I bought time for the internet ($-- per day for high-speed internet). i used it on my laptop. Then when i tried to use it on my iPhone, the system gave some message which i had no idea what to do. I was lost and had to call the helpline to get the problem solved.

"Just returned from a --day family vacation to Chicago, and we were impressed with the Doubletree Hotel. All the staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Concierge helped us navigate our way on bus routes, and helped my husband figure out a problem with his Stubhub tickets for the Cubs game.
Getting around town from the Doubletree was easy, and we were Chicago newbies. The bus stop we used most often was - blocks away. We were close enough to walk the whole way to Navy Pier. We parked our van at InterPark, which is just across the street from Doubletree and significantly cheaper than the hotel lot. We could see our car from our hotel window. Very easy walk to Dominick's grocery store (bought our visitor bus passes there), ----, West Egg Cafe, Baskin Robins ice cream. Everything you need is nearby.
The room was clean, had - queen size beds, and bathroom was fine. Room had ironing board and hair dryer. We were advised at check-in to move the snack tray (with computer sensors on it) up high so our kids wouldn't fool with it, causing charges to the room. When my husband tried to move the tray up high, all the snacks fell off and we were worried we would be charged for everything! The front desk clerk was understanding, and said it was no problem. This must happen often...
The rooftop pool was nice, had plenty of chairs and towels, and was the perfect relaxation spot after our long days of sightseeing. Kids thought it was cool to swim on the rooftop surrounded by all the buildings of Chicago. An unexpected bonus: We could see the Wednesday night Navy Pier fireworks from the rooftop pool area. 
We did not want to pay $-- extra to have a refrigerator in the room, so we brought our own cooler with drinks, some kid snacks, and a gallon of milk. This way, we could eat a quick breakfast in the room (single-serve cereal bowls and some fruit) before heading out for our activities. Saved money and more convenient, and we just refilled the cooler with the hotel ice machine when needed.
This hotel was perfect for our needs, the location was great, staff were friendly, and the price was right. We did not have trouble with elevators. There are - elevators running at all times, and though we were on the --nd floor, we never felt like the elevators were slowing us down at all.

We were given an upgrade so had a kitchen attached to our room. The room was large and very comfortable, clean and well equipped - the free wifi worked well too. Best of all was the afternoon cheese and wine get-together where we made fascinating contacts with other guests. We were offered free wine and snacks for over an hour, with a waiter coming round to fill glasses. There was a jar for gratuities which we gave to generously because we were so impressed. Breakfast was included and this was a simple selection of pastries and fruit, with tea and coffee - really all you need to fortify you for a day exploring SF. Good position near Union Square.

This last stay, I had a slight problem, I misplaced a shoe bag in my hotel room. It was a very silly thing. It may have very well been my fault. I just couldn't find it and neither could housekeeping. Initially, they thought they might have thrown it away by mistake, they were quite apologetic. When I left, I called security at the hotel. The shoe bag, while having almost no commercial value was a very well made, old cloth felt bag passed down to me from my father. The security person treated this as if it was an heirloom diamond ring. After an exhaustive search of the room and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""key records"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to make sure it wasn't stolen, they found my shoe bag after they re-searched the room for the um-teenth time.

"I stayed at the hotel with my husband , a -.- yr old and a -- month old infant. We stayed for - nights. We have been reading a lot of the reviews before booking, and decided to go with hampton inn because of price, and the location. We made sure to ask for a room facing the front - habor. At night we could hear the trains, but it wasn't to a point where the noise would wake me up. If you were still awake in bed, you could hear it, but it was like a backgound noise from a far. They provided ear plugs but i did not need to use them. My children did not wake up at night from the train, so which means it wasn't bad at all. I slept very well, as the bed sheets felt very clean. The washrooms were clean. Service was great. 
When we arrived, the hotel system was down, but the staff did not delay us from checking in. They still gave us our room. It also included breakfast..which was surprisingly good. I thought it was breakfast only with croissants, and bagels...but there were hot food i.e. eggs, sausages..and two machines where we could make our own hot waffles. It was awesome with variety of juices.

We had planned to take a taxi but they noted that they had a car service we could use and it was a flat rate in a nice sedan. Much nicer than a taxi ride for the same price.
And the staff mentioned our anniversary at check-in and we found a gift waiting for us in the room. Nice touch!
Our room was clean and fairly spacious (king premiere is what I believe they called it). We had a king bed and a sitting area with a couch and chair. The floor to ceiling mirrors were an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""interesting"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" touch. ;)
Our room faced a busy street and it was readily apparent that the walls were pretty thin. We faced a parking garage (with a Safeway - so grocery items are close) and every time the exit gate opened an alarm would go off. We heard that all throughout the night. And trash pick up one morning and normal motorcycle-car traffic sounds were pretty loud. But having stayed in big cities before - it's kind of normal. Still... that's the reason for an AVERAGE on the sleeping rate scale.
The location was nice - just a couple of blocks from the Wharf. And plenty of places to eat-drink in the area. If you come out the front door - cross the street and then go left and there's a great place to eat breakfast (Hollywood Diner or something very similar). Huge omelets!!!
The hotel is pricey (almost $----night for our stay thanks to a reduce Sunday rate) but that's pretty much the norm for Fisherman's Wharf. Would stay here again.",happy
"My husband and children were looking for a room to stay while we visited six flags fiesta Texas and since he stays at holiday inn for business we thought we'd give them a shot. First off they offer NO continental breakfast at the very least. Come on how hard is coffee juice and doughnuts? Instead you are offered a --% discount to their onsite restaurant. Secondly we were given the option of a late checkout and we took it only to find the wifi no longer worked the second day without an additional password that we had to call down for. Lastly, the room was stuffy! We lowered the ac to -- degrees in an effort to cool the room and it struggled all night. Save your money and head on down a bit further for a better hotel!",not happy
This property has been renovated. While not in the newest area of LA it was convenient to our location in Encino. The staff was friendlhy and helpful. Rooms clean and quiet. The common areas were not very enticing but the value was excellent and all I was looking for was a good room.,happy
Close to Space needle and EMP and duck rides parking lot was poor.,happy
"I stayed at this hotel for four nights during a business trip. The hotel was extremely noisy, and I was woken up every night (between -am--am) either by people shouting on the corridor, having a phone call right in front of my door, or having a loud conversation at the ice dispenser-soda vending machine which was located right next to my room (and was about as noisy as an A-C unit). The walls are too thin, so you can hear everything that's going on outside the rooms. The experience of my colleagues, who were staying on different floors, was similar. The rooms aren't bad but certainly not upscale. The elevators are old and take forever. The staff wasn't rude, but not overly friendly or helpful either. On the morning when I left I wanted to call the reception to tell them to call me a taxi, but nobody picked up. For $--- a night (excluding breakfast) I'd expect a little bit more than that, and I've stayed at significantly better hotels downtown for less. There's also a safe deposit box for which you're charged extra whether you use it or not. Also, stay away from the Tresoro restaurant; the service is good and friendly, but the food is below average (and certainly not authentic Italian).",not happy

"For all those fellow travelers who are tired of airports and the eternal stresses that have developed around simply taking a plane ride, you will find tremendous solace in a small island of tranquility at the Grand Hyatt DFW Airport.
On a recent trip to Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo, Mexico, we were traveling through DFW from Washington DC. Due to forecasted snow on our day of departure, American Airlines cancelled our outbound flight and they re-booked us so that we over-nighted, at our expense though, in Dallas in order to catch the one-day-a-week flight to Ixtapa.
You should note that there are two Hyatt hotels at DFW. In terminal C is the Hyatt Regency DFW and in terminal D is the Grand Hyatt. We decided to choose the Grand Hyatt given that our plane was due to leave from this very same terminal. To our surprise, the Grand Hyatt is a stunning hotel even superior to any city hotel in which we have stayed let along the reputation of “airport” hotels.
In the event that you arrive at any other terminal, there are regular (free) airport shuttles that will take you to the Grand Hyatt in terminal D. For starters, once one collects their bags in terminal D, it is a very easy walk and an escalator ride to the elevators to the Hyatt. What struck me as we approached the hotel elevators was that the American Airlines check-in (for our following day departure) could not have been more than -- steps away with the security area literally adjacent to it. Nothing like rolling out of bed and checking-in for your flight!
Exiting the hotel elevator, you will be presented with a well appointed lobby to your left and to your right a very attractive bar and restaurant. This hotel also offers conference facilities that are rather impressive. Our west facing room was a suite on the sixth floor that was spacious with a living room and very large bedroom. The décor is modern and minimalist with a very fancy lighting and (electric) blind-curtain system. The standard amenities are all included. Yet, a peculiarity was noted that we never experienced: you have to call the reception so that they can deliver a coffee maker-pot for the room. This is very odd. Although the rooms are well insulated and may be stating the obvious, you will hear some noise of the departing aircrafts even if they may not be using the runways in front of terminal D. Yet, traffic subsides significantly after --pm. 
A quick tour of the property is worth it not just to familiarize oneself, but to appreciate the many amenities. Aside from the expansive conference facilities and business center, it has a very good fitness center, outdoor pool and sun deck. Features that I am sure would come in handy when staying during warmer months. The restaurant is very large and attractive. We have a very tasty breakfast the following morning.
This hotel was a great stress reliever due to our initial tempestuous departure and it reset the tone for our one week vacation.",happy
"After reading a lot of reviews about this hotel, I thought I'd just take a chance since I got a good deal with free parking. I have mixed reviews about my stay in this hotel.
The location is as perfect as it can be - right on Wisconsin Avenue where all the restaurants and trendy stores are located. The major M Street is only a block away and Washington Harbor is in a walking distance from the hotel. There's a metro stop-circulatory right in front of the hotel which takes you to Union Station via M Street, downtown, china town, Smithsonian Museums and the Mall so I'd strongly suggest you to take that mode of transportation ($- per ride or $- for a day pass) rather than a taxi or your car - Saves a lot of money and time.
Despite it's ideal location, the hotel is pretty old and needs a overall """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""MAKEOVER"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". The bathrooms as well as the room itself needs a lot of updating. I could see molds on the corners of our room ceiling and our bed post was broken as badly repaired. The TV's are one of those old models and none of the channels are clear enough to watch.
I would recommend this hotel for it's ideal location and only if you get a good deal.",not happy
"Clean, friiendly and in a great location. Good sized rooms with en suite. The hotewl was quiet and we heard nothing at night time.
If your on the trip of a lifetime then its not the place, if your made of money its probably not got the facilities BUT if you want clean, friendly and homely then its great value for money. For UK guests its a bit like booking into a seaside guesthouse and being pleasantly surprised by the standards.
I researched the net for hours and hours before I booked and if your spending less than $--- per night on a room you won't beat this place.",happy
"Walking from the old Greyhound station to the new, my camera had to record the black metal staircase against the red building, half an hour later, after getting two night on Priceline at a 'FINE rate', I was more than surpried to find myself checking into the same building on -th Ave in historic Gaslamp district. So convenient for my preferred walking habits, accesible to CBD, Convention Centre etc.
Trainee check me in, Had a good room with a bathroom view of the High end hotels and street. Pity there was no computer for resident's use, i am one of those without laptop not smartphone. All i all, will stay again, if i get the same rock bottom rate. Oh yes, the historic lift was a joy to ride and was the access to the rood for seeing the city and different times of the day",happy

"We had some reservations staying some distance away from the usual mid town hot spots but were very pleased to find that the hotel is so close to the main subways including the A line express which will get you to the action within -- mins, The hotel is also close to TriBeca, Greenwich and Chinatown so gives a different perspective on NY life. The financial district itself is also well served for good restaurants and bars. The hotel looks a bit tired from the outside but we found our room to be spacious and very clean. The bed so comfortable, the bathroom - small, but it was all there and again very clean. In short great value and location - would definitely go there again,",happy
"We booked a great rate of £--- per night for a Deluxe Room, including breakfast for - and valet parking. 
Check in was fast and efficient, although we were given the wrong room type initially. I suspect the rate we booked might have been a mistake as it soon disappeared online, and that the hotel were trying to get away with giving us a standard room because of this. Anyway, this was no problem and we were swiftly moved to a Deluxe (Corner) room.
The room is lovely and large, with huge windows on two sides overlooking Coit Tower in one direction and towards Nob Hill in the other. The room was decorated in soothing grey-blues and neutral tones, and was truly a relaxing and pleasant place to be and wake up every morning. The bed was large and comfortable and the room was equipped with a soft seating area in one corner, a table with four chairs and a huge desk area - nothing had been overlooked. The entrance lobby was large enough to accommodate an extra bed for our - year old which worked great as it felt like she had an area separate to ours. The table and chairs was a fantastic bonus, as we were able to comfortably enjoy take-outs when getting over jetlag and not feeling like eating out. The bathrrom was large with a floor to ceiling window (which let in lots of light but it was rather disconcerting to sit on the loo overlooking the buildings opposite!!). Unfortunately our room did not have a bath, just a large walk in shower. We did not notice this until after the bell boy had left us, and did not have the heart to complain again, due in no small part to the room being so fantastic in every other way. 
The breakfast included was good with plenty of choice of cereal and dried fruits, yoghurts, toast, muffins etc and a small selection of cooked items. We had to pay extra for our small daughter but this amounted to probably $-- a day including tip, so we didn't mind too much as we were getting a good deal overall. We didn't eat in the restaurant-sports bar, but it looked busy and buzzing when we passed. 
The pool area is nice, although in April the heated pool was not heated enough to compensate for the rather chilly air, but no matter.
Overall this was one of my favourite hotels during our trip to the US. We were once loyal Fairmont guests, but decide to forego the opportunity to stay there on this trip to San Francisco. At no point during our stay did I ever regret this. The Hyatt is well placed for touristy things that kids like at the Wharf and is convenient for transport links elsewhere. I would definitely return here.",happy
Great place for stay to hit the Northwest Highway @ --E area or Composite Drive area of Dallas,happy
"We stayed at this hotel because it was a bit less costly than many other area hotels. The room was big enough and the hotel isn't a fleabag place...its tolerable but don't expect the Ritz Carlton. Finishes are banged up and worn and there isn't too much care that goes into the place. When the lobby furniture is stained and threadbare it tells you something about the management.
You wonder what might be lurking in the carpet and the mattress.
For a little more you can stay at the Excelsior on --st bet CPW and Columbus...its much better.",not happy
"We chose this hotel because of the location. And it was really sufficient for our needs. The staff was excellent. Really friendly hospitality and eager to help out. We were quite surprised to see the Hotel room had ear plugs on the desk, as well as sleeping pills on top of the mini bar. We were on the second floor the first night, and requested to be moved, because the noise from the street, and the construction nearby was loud most of the night. The earplugs didn't work! They are currently undergoing renovations to the outside of the building, so the view was mostly of scaffolding. There was no hot water in our room, despite a request to have it looked at. We were moved to a floor higher up for our second night, and it was a much better experience. Sleep was easier and the room was cleaner and had hot water, and was more enjoyable for us. (although it wasn't the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in). My advice is to make sure you are on a higher floor. The hotel didn't have room upgrades available, despite their request to upgrade you when you advertise your stay on social media. Despite all this, we still really enjoyed our selves, and would say we had a good experience.",not happy
"We stayed at the Belleclaire for eleven nights during our summer vacation. The hotel itself is nothing special, but the room was at advertised, quite spacey, and even had a window-type airconditioning unit (which wasn't mentioned on Expedia). The room and the (shared) bathroom were kept clean, and for the budget price there was nothing to complain about. All in all it was good value for the money, considering that this was central Manhattan.
However, as of August ---- there's still construction work going on. After one week, they started installing new floor panels in the neighbouring rooms. After complaining, we were offered a room on a different floor; the new room had the same standard as the old one, but was smaller and had a window to the backyard. We were told that our original room was the only """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""larger economy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room, so we decided to stay there in spite of the noise. (On the pro side, they'll now have renovated rooms with wooden floors instead of worn carpet). 
The location was very good, central park is only two blocks away, there are subway stations nearby and a bus is also going from the --th street - which is much nicer than the subway, if you have the time. There are supermarkts, food places and plenty of city life; if you like you can also get to many attractions by foot. 
The staff was generally friendly and helpful. By the way, if you want to make international calls, get a phone card from the newspaper shop around the corner (as the receptionist suggested to me). You'll still pay $- per call for the line, but that's much better than $---- per minute ;-)",not happy
"I'm not really sure how Marriott allowed this hotel to brand itself as a Renaissance. My wife, my one year old son and I were stranded in Philadelphia after our flight was cancelled. Here is my review-
-. Transportation. The airport shuttle drivers were terrific. The individual that picked us up from the airport was friendly and helpful. Another shuttle bus driver agreed to take my wife to a local store to get baby formula. They went well beyond their jobs to help out.
-. Physical Condition: As we pulled up to the hotel, I immediately recognized the hotel as an old Radission that I had stayed in back in '--. Given that the hotel was now carrying the Renaissance name, I had expected that it had been renovated. No such luck. The room (Room ---) was aging, the door lock latch was broken and the bathtub drained extremely slowly. 
-. Cleanliness: The hotel housekeeping staff isn't performing its' job. There was a stain on the comforter and a dirty tissue from a previous guest left behind the curtains. Additionally, our room had an indoor balcony that had a dead cockroach on it. If you're an optimist, I suppose you could say that it was an indication that they hotel's pest control service is doing its' job, but I'd prefer not to see cockroaches in the hotels in which I'm staying. 
-. Service. I had to make the request for crib three times before one was finally brought to our room. I will say that my negative experiences were all with the nighttime hotel staff. Our interactions with the day staff were somewhat better. 
I hate to give this hotel a poor rating because the shuttle bus drivers were so helpful and went out of their way to help. However, the reality is that this hotel is a really about a - --- star property.",not happy
"I live in Chicago and had stayed at The Trump Chicago once when it first opened. I had a standard room and was blown away at the excess amenities. In most hotels, you need to book one of the more """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""elite"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" rooms to have a wow factor, but not at The Trump. Since I had such a great experience the first time, I decided to look into booking a suite for my --th birthday. I explained to the concierge that I was hoping to have a small get together in the hotel suite. Upon arriving, I felt like a Queen. When I first walked into the suite, there was a birthday cake with a card, hand written from the GM. The suite had a guest bathroom ( complete with a TV in the mirror) a full service kitchen, fully stocked with numerous bottles of champagne, snacks, and other alcoholic beverages, a full living room and dining room, and master suite. The master suite had floor to ceiling windows with an AMAZING city view. The master bathroom had a huge double vanity, separate room for toilet, and full jacuzzi tub and separate shower. There was a separate """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""powder room"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and of course, there were already robes and slippers laid out on the huge California King. The suite was also wired with surround sound, three plasma TVs and two ipod docks. I was beyond amazed at this room, and I was able to have a fabulous birthday. The Trump truly is about living a life of luxury. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone who is interested in seeing Chicago in style. I have been to both bars at The Trump, on this occasion, as well as others. The drinks are phenomenal and are all hand crafted, but quite pricey. The only negative thing I would have to say is that I was quite astounded at the amount they charged for incidentals. On a $--- room, there were over $--- in incidentals, which was insane. Also, they accidently charged someone's bar tab to my room.",happy
"I will admit that my family and I had a lovely time. My --year old loved the ponds and lagoons filled with ducks and other exotic birds (buy feed in the market and you will be surrounded by them!). We mainly stayed at the larger pool, which had bar and grill service. The pool is nothing fancy, but not very deep, so we did not have to worry as much. I wish that there were slides or a water feature--something to make the pool stand out. 
The room was fine--again, nothing fancy, but pretty large for a standard garden room (make sure that yours is NOT overlooking the parking lot). We enjoyed the chairs on our patio overlooking one of the lagoons--we brought a couple of bottle of wine and were able to chill it in the in-room fridge. There are NO luxuries (some would say, no basics even)...no robe, not water bottles, no turn-down service, no hair dryer, only - glasses and - paper cups for coffee. In fact, we returned to our room at -pm one day and it STILL had not had maid service--we called and it was close to -pm when she came. Not happy about that. But, on the whole, the room was clean and pleasant. They still have the ancient in-wall A-C which needs updating. There was also bits of trash around the entrance of our room--it is these small details which completely keeps the place from truly being a resort.
BUT, the Barefoot and Baleen Restaurants are excellent--really good food, nice ambiance, generous portions. Room service was fast and delicious. My child cried when it was time to leave because we did not have enough time to do all that there is to do (we missed the movie at night over the pool, the bike rides, fire pits on the beach). SO, in some ways it was fantastic, some ways, completely disappointing. Truly, as long as the kid is happy, the bed is decent and Mom can get a good cocktail, I count our vacation as a success.",not happy

First, paid too much at ~----night but that's not the hotel's fault. Hotel is well-located, fairly quiet, comfortable bed, so slept well. I suppose those, along with cleanliness, are the most important things to us when we travel. Expected more, though. Bedroom on --th floor was tiny, barely room to move around and no space to even stow our suitcases without having them in the way. Tiny bathroom, shower, no bath. No in-room safe. Fitness room had a handful of aerobic machines, single universal gym with very small weight stack. Free wifi and computer in the lobby - Wifi was fine but lobby computer was painfully slow. Lemon-water at the front desk was a much appreciated touch on return from our many walks around town. Staff friendly enough. Didn't eat or drink in-house as there are many places to eat and drink within a block or two.

Rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious. The bathroom is beautiful. Location is perfect - about - blocks from --th street. Valet service was always courteous and helpful (giving directions, offering cold water, baggage assistance, holding doors, etc) - it was a pleasure to come back to the hotel and in and out privileges are included with valet.

Only negative would be the internet service - when you purchased internet for the room at $-.--, it only allows one login (not good for a family that travels with - iphones and - computers). Also, connection cannot be used anywhere else in the hotel. I know this is the norm for hotels, but it's getting a bit old when we pay as much for one week of service at the hotel that we pay for - months of service at home - and the home service is faster.

The location is close to bus stops and walking distance to the subway (- blocks). Very, very convenient.

Some of the staff were helpful, some not so much. We had an issue with the prepayment of the room through a third party website which could have been dealt with better but overall this hotel is very good for a Houston visit.",happy
"Stayed at the Omni for two nights on business travel. From the moment I arrived when the valet picked up my car, to the moment I departed when the valet returned my car, I experienced nothing but great customer service from Omni's staff. A first I was skeptical, thinking that the staff was being nice to perhaps make up for less adequate rooms, but when I opened the door to my room, I found it to be clean, comfortable and modern. No dust or crumbs around the baseboards. The mattress was high and firm. The sheets were white and the beds were decorated with accent pillows. The bathroom featured a separate shower and tub, complimentary toilettries and clean, white shower rugs. I also used the fitness center and was impressed with the number and condition of the cardio machines. Most hotels have one or two machines that are terribly outdated. The fitness center at the Omni was spacious and featured elliptical machines, treadmills with mini tvs, and some machine and free weights. The free weights were a little on the old side, but the overall fitness room was more than what I expected. Further, the Omni has a courtesy car that can take you to any business location in the city! I definitely recommend the Omni if service, cleanliness and amenities are of importance to you.",happy
"When we arrived our room was not ready. They offered to keep our bags for us until our room was ready. When we went to pick up our bags, the knapsack containing a laptop was missing. The staff told us we only checked - bags - that the -th bag never existed - maybe we left it in the car - maybe we dropped it. 
We were booked in this hotel for two nights through Expedia.ca. We cancelled the -nd night - and interesting thing is that after the Expedia agent called the hotel to say why we were checking out, suddenly they remembered the bag but told us other customers had stolen it. 
Before we checked out the front desk gave us the names of - couples and their phone numbers so we could all them to see if they had taken our knapsack. Yes that is right the gave us their names and phone numbers. 
This plus the fighting and loud music -am to -am 
Yes I know you get what you pay for but I have stayed in other - star Travelodge hotels before and they were fine. 
My first visit to San Francisco - and I am leaving my laptop - not my heart! I have no proof but who do you think stole the knapsack? I hope who ever stole my laptop - really needed it. 
And yes for those of you reading this that will say """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""you should not have left your laptop"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I know that too!",not happy
"Loved the hotel and its location! We're a family of six, and picking a hotel is always a delicate balancing act. We need enough room where we don't drive each other crazy but it also needs to be relatively affordable. The Affinia Dumont was perfect for our --night holiday stay in NYC. We had a --bedroom skyline suite with - queen beds in the bedroom and a pull-out sofa in the living room. Beautiful view of the city, including the Chrysler Building. 
The suite had a roomy foyer-like area at its entry-way which was great for the keeping of our shoes and boots. There was also a really nice dresser - closet - dressing area in the bedroom area outside of the bathroom that was great for keeping our suitcases, dirty clothes, and collection of jackets out of our way. 
The kitchen was set off in a little room by itself, which I really liked. It was very small but had everything you could need - full size refrigerator, toaster, microwave, decent-size sink, coffee maker, gas (!!) stovetop with oven, dishwasher, and lots of drawer and cupboard space. It was also stocked with silverware, plates, bowls, cups, glasses, a couple of pots, and a frying pan. There was service for four and we needed more; we requested more and they quickly stocked it with service for six for us. 
The bathroom was surprisingly roomy and had plenty of shelf space for all our things - a typical one over the sink area and then another deep one on another wall. Water pressure in the shower was good, but like in a lot of hotels, the water fluctuated between very, very cool and very, very warm.
The staff were all particularly competent and friendly - from before our trip down right through the time we (sadly) had to leave. Check-in was quick and efficient, and the bellman (Donald, I believe) was super welcoming and helpful. The front desk manager David was very helpful in planning our stay, and housekeeping did a great job every day.
We fully utilized a number of the hotel's offerings - kitchen (in its entirety!), the pillow menu, the bathrobes, the telescope (requested with the skyline suite), the DVD player (that was brought up within ~- minutes of our request!), the steam shower, the fitness room, the strengthening kit - and truly appreciated them. I booked the room through the Affinia website and had a lot of fun with their My Affinia - My Concierge.
The hotel has recently been renovated, and they did a terrific job. Everything was very nice and tastefully done. Both rooms had large flat-screen TVs. Beds were very comfortable, and down pillows were plentiful. We were on the --th floor and had no problems whatsoever with the elevators. We found them to be quite speedy - both in arrival time and travel time. Lobby is relatively small but inviting and seemingly comfortable - there were always people in it on their computers. We didn't use it, so I can't say how the internet service is.
The Murray Hill location is a joy. In the past, we've tended to stay in the Theater District, but I greatly preferred staying in Murray Hill. I like that it has more of a neighborhood feel but it's still so convenient to anyplace you'd want to go. We easily walked all over - to and from Times Square and Broadway a couple of times, to Grand Central, back from the American Museum of Natural History, up to and through Central Park (all the way up to --th St). If you don't like walking that much or the weather is bad, the closest subway station is just a little over a block away. 
There are a lot of parking lots right around the hotel. The hotel offered to valet park for us for $-- - -- hours, but we didn't mind finding parking on our own. The first one we tried (right across the street) was full, the second one we tried didn't want to take our minivan, but the third one worked out (for $-- - -- hours - a great rate for the city). So be patient - there are enough around that you'll get a spot.
While the Murray Hill deli on the corner is nice for grabbing one or two things, there's a great grocery store (D'Agostino's) right around the corner (-rd Ave and --th St). We also really enjoyed eating lunch at the close-by Banc Cafe on -rd Ave and --th St - very low-key and relaxing atmosphere, excellent food and service. If you like Indian food, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Curry Hill"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is just a few blocks down on Lexington. We had planned to eat down there one night, but time got away from us and we didn't get to. Next time. We had Christmas breakfast at the hotel-affiliated Barking Dog, and that was great too.
We just got home last night, and I've already highly recommended the hotel to several people. My entire family felt extremely comfortable, and we are looking forward to going back. 
This hotel is a real gem in the city, and I'm so grateful that we stumbled upon it in particular and the Affinia group in general.
Thanks to everyone at Affinia Dumont for helping to make our holiday in the city so wonderful!!",happy
"Every question I asked staff got an automatic """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""No"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" answer. No one went out of their way for anything. What I was most shocked about was the fact that we has a huge seminar with about --- people and they closed the dining room for dinner! What poor customer service AND a loss of money for them. The staff at the restaurant did not understand why I thought it was a big deal that it was closed when we had more than --- people walking down stairs who could have filled the dining room in minutes if it was open. 
 Managment, the employees you have on staff have declined over the years. I used to come to your place alot when staff was friendly and looked to see how they could get YES answers for customers. The front desk staff today had terrible customer service skills. I won't be coming here again unless I hear from others that there was a HUGE change to staff and customer service.

"We stayed at the SF Financial District Hilton for - split nights bookending a trip to the wine country. It does have a good location near Chinatown and North Beach. Rooms are adequate, but nothing special. While we read the complaints of street noise, I could not imagine noise up on the --th floor, but true to the reports it was incredibly noisy. I can only guess that the surrounding buildings funnel the noise to the hotel rooms. The hotel was full from business travelers and service was mediocre in general. As Hilton Diamond members we were given coupons for appetizers at the lounge. When we paid our bill we presented the coupons and were told rather rudely that we should have presented the coupons BEFORE ordering as the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""free"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" appetizers were smaller portions. Since we only had a small plate of Nachos I cannot see the extra cost being significant. All in all, the location and reasonable price of the hotel would outweigh the noise level for us as my wife always travels with earplugs to manage my snoring. Be sure to request a bay view room as they are much more desirable than the city view.",not happy
"Hotels needs a makeover! Stains all over the carpets and walls. Spackling on the walls and in bathtub. Bed was uncomfortable and there was hair on the pillows, disgusting.

"Stayed at the Bedford for - days in april and have to say for what we paid to stay was well worth it. The location is the whole point of the Bedford and as well as being clean and tidy you have to put up with the odd rattle of the plumbing during the night .
- minutes away from the heart of the city at grand central while it is a bit old and grand I would recommend this hotel if you want to spend your money on 'seeing ' New York as opposed to spending it 'staying ' in New York",happy
"Stayed at this location for - nights during the first week of August. Rooms and baths are small but clean and comfortable. Our King bed room had a microwave, fridge, coffee maker with coffee and iron with board. We were on the -th floor, which was quite with a view at back of the building. There are -- floors with about -- rooms per floor (based on the -th floor plan). Our stay was comfortable, price was within our budget (under $--- per day with taxes) and we liked the location of the hotel. In terms of safety the front of the hotel is well lit. We returned to the hotel after midnight two nights and felt totally safe as there were still a lots of people on the street. Did not try any of the amenities at the hotel but seemed as though a lot of people were at the bar in the evenings.
The only gripe(not a big one) I had was that even with - elevators we had to wait (occasionally) for the elevator for some considerable amounts of time. Seemed as though room service, maintenance and housekeeping were also using the same elevators (should add that none of the staff got on the elevators if customers were waiting for the elevators, which was courteous of them).
Location: This hotel is one block away from the Empire State building and walking distance to Times Square (about - blocks), Rockefeller Center (about -- blocks), MoMA and Broadway shows. 
Subway: The Herald Square Station is right next to the hotel for the N,Q,R,B,D,F and M subway lines. Penn Station (-th Ave and --th street) is two blocks away and you can get on A,C,E and -,- and - subway lines. We took line - from Penn Station to the South Ferry Station for Battery Park and Statue of Liberty tour. These stations are convenient to to go Uptown or Downtown on the West side
If you need to go uptown on the east side of Manhattan (e.g.. to the Met or Guggenheim) and want to take -,- or - subway lines you will have to walk a little more to Grand Central at --nd and Lexington (for -,- and -) or --rd and Park (for -).
Getting There: We took the E train from Penn Station to Jamaica Ave Station and switched to the Airtrain for JFK with two big boxes (during non-peak hours) and it was pretty easy. The trip cost us $-.-- ($-.-- on the E and $- for the Airtrain). I would suggest doing this if you are flying in to JFK. This is the cheapest and fastest option to get to the hotel.",happy
"My family (- girls ages - & -) and my husband stayed here for a week from August - to the --, ---- in one room with - 'queen' beds.
For those of you who want a quick summary, it's here at the top, the details are all below.
Summary:
------------
Cons:
* beds were small, ac was noisy, rooms smell of vapor-rub
* avoid the pool and hot-tub Sunday evening through Wednesday night - it's a health hazard
* outdoor area has mosquitos, bring bug spray for evenings outdoors in the restaurant or at the pool area
* family budget: restaurant is typical san diego prices which are expensive for a family, eat elsewhere if possible if you're on a budget or utilize the restaurants happy hour for a good deal -- the food we did have was good tho.
* you cannot SAFELY walk to the beach from this hotel, even tho it's advertised as such
Pros:
* Rooms were clean, comfortable, and well appointed. Hotel was in a business neighborhood and we felt safe at the hotel.
* Shuttle service was prompt and helpful for trips to the beach
* Pool area was fun and well designed (but only use when the pool has been cleaned)
* well located for access to san-diego - seaworld, and legoland
The only reason we stayed here is because we got a --% off deal on the room, and it was close to the beach, and it looked like the pool area would be great for the kids, which turned out to be NOT the case because the pool was so dirty during most of our stay there. I would not stay here again at the same ($--- per night with) or full price.
Details:
----------
-. The rooms are decent sized, beds are comfortable, it was clean. The 'queen' beds are actually doubles or very close to it -- much smaller 'queens' than in any other hotel we've stayed at. The kids were accidentally kicking and hitting each other at night, The room's a-c unit was very loud, not just the normal fan sound but a loud buzzing background noise as well -- if you are a light sleeper that needs to be cool I would suggest avoiding this hotel. The rooms smell like vapor rub -- other reviewers said that the rooms smelled, and maybe this is the hotels way of trying to freshen it up, it wasn't over-powering to us, but when you arrived it was noticeable for the first - minutes or so.
-. Food and amenities -- the hotel nickels and dimes you for amenities like internet access ($---day) we didn't use it, because both our smart phones have -G. Eating out in San Diego is expensive, and the hotels restaurant is no exception. We avoided the breakfast buffet at $-- per adult, $- - kid, and instead walked a block to the nearby Green Leaf Cafe (a business cafe) and got a decent breakfast for the whole family for $---$--. We also found that the hotels happy happy hour between ---pm was great, and during that time would split a few appetizers ($--- each vs $----- per entree during regular hours) for dinner with the kids, however most nights we didn't make it back to the hotel until after happy hour was over.
-. The pool -- if you have kids who love to swim, and are coming to this hotel to use the pool, be WARNED, there are some caveats.To save money the hotel only turns on their pool pump and cleans their pool once per week, and they do it just in time for the largest arrival of guests which is on Thursday and Friday. We arrived on Monday night, and about the first thing we did was jump into the hot tub and pool -- and in about - minutes we were disgusted (rating D-). There were arm sized clumps of human hair floating around the bottom of the pool, there was some kind of deteriorating paper item in the bottom of the pool (maxipad, diaper, or tissue -- I'm not sure but who wanted to get close enough to find out). In addition to the gross stuff on the bottom, the tops of the pool and hot tub were covered in leafs, bugs, normal pool debris, etc. The pool pump and filters were NOT running. There was a large brown bathtub ring around the top edge of the hot-tub. In addition, there were mosquitos outside, and I ended up getting bitten several times that evening, even tho we were outdoors for about -- min.
All of us who swam that night (me and the two kids) had red spots on our skin and few itchy bumps show up in the next few days -- tea tree oil was great for getting rid of these. I was ready to report the hotel pool to the del mar health department the next day.
We avoided the pool for the next few days, mostly because as our schedule had it we were slated for the beach, sea world, and legoland -- but also beacuse we hoped that the dirty pool was an oversight or the result of a broken pump and it would be better the next time. Friday morning we had a chance to check out the pool again, and it looked to our amazement, much better -- I would say a B+ rating. Friday night they had a movie showing in the pool area, which was a lot of fun -- and the pool was clean enough our kids actually enjoyed swimming in it.
Other reviewers also commented on the disgusting pool, and an fun pool so the schedule explains how both can be accurate.
-. Laundry -- there is no laundry room in this hotel that guests can do their laundry in -- very disapointing. As we expected to be able to split up and let the kids stay in the pool with one of us, while the other took care of the laundry. The hotel does have a laundry service, but given the prices of everything else there, I suspect it would have added another nights worth of cost or more to our bill to do a family of fours --days worth of laundry -- so we ended up having to leave the pool and movie, and spend Friday night at the landromat at del mar heights, and ate dinner next door with the kids while the clothes washed. 
-. Shuttle: The hotel provides a free shuttle to anywhere within - miles of the hotel, which includes del mar beach -- this was the best beach we found for quality (bathrooms and changing area were amazing here) and crowd we had plenty of space to ourselves. When I called the hotel to ask about the shuttle service and other questions, the operator was fairly curt and impatient. But the shuttle service was nice -- the picked us up at a cafe we found near the beach.
-a. Speaking of the beach: the booking site we used said you could walk to the beach from the hotel. We asked at the front desk while we were there, and they said there was NO safe way to walk to the beach from this hotel, unless you wanted to walk along the interstate freeway with young kids. This seems like false advertising to me.
-. Yelp -- if you have a smart phone and a car, Yelp! came in extremely handy for finding good places with decent prices to eat. The GPS-google maps were also invaluable.",not happy
"Enjoyed Intercon during July -th Weekend and had great view of Town of Addison Fireworks Display. King rooms are quite spacious, in good shape - property is well maintained. Room service menu offers good variety.",happy
"Stayed for business and was thoroughly unimpressed. For $----night I had expected much more. The lobby feels somewhat seedy and run-down, and lent a shoddy feeling to the place. The uniformed security guards at a desk by the elevator didn't lend me confidence either (""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""oh, it's that kind of place""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""). SPG Platinum ambassador and all I got was a king room where the safe, one phone, and half the wall outlets didn't work. Rooms were run down with the barest efforts made to make them look good (enough so that the picture on SPG.com doesn't show it). Hallways were worse - just depressing. Walking down the hallways felt like walking through a crappy motel in central Europe - dirty, worn carpet, and old, excessively narrow doors. Attention to detail was seriously lacking - even the plate with my room number on it in the hall way had been wiped with an excessively-dirty sponge and the dirty water had dried all over it - I would say that this is a metaphor for the entire hotel. Lobby restaurant was nothing special, and the breakfast buffet was unappealing. Hotel is populated by annoying groups of tourists, and there are not enough elevators so that it is impossible to find one during high traffic hours that isn't already dangerously over-packed. Wouldn't stay again by any means.",not happy
"The room was in very poor condition. There were not enough light bulbs in the light fixtures, and one lamp did not work at all. Not enough electric outlets, towels, or coffee. The door jamb had been broken, the toilet paper holder had been broken, broken or missing tiles in the bathroom had been painted over, the bathtub was stained, the carpet was filthy. The pillows did not look clean. The microwave oven had been partially torn from its bracket; we did not look inside the oven or the refrigerator.
As well, we were put into a room whose door opened onto a fence around the pool and which was located next to the stairs, even though the motel was far from full.",not happy
"We stay at the Long Wharf Marriott every year on our passage to Maine to visit with family.

However, with the aid of the exceptionally helpful staff at the Long Wharf Marriott our stays are always successful and pleasant memories. 
Last year we were due to fly out during the largest storm of the year. I phoned ahead and asked the desk clerk if we could check into our room early. She understood that we had little ones with us and might need some extra help. After a short hold, she promised an upgraded room with early check-in approx. - hours before normal check-in time. Upon arrival our car was quickly ushered into covered parking and our little one's noses never had to touch the blizzard's frozen bite. Our -th level room had a fantastic view of the harbor & some city life overlooking a small park - which beautifully lights up at night giving off a mixture of blue saphire color. 
The location is perfect for runs to the nearby famous Quincy Market for any type of food (a range which spans the globe) - our favorite is the Sri-Lankan. We made the most of our time by visiting the Boston Aquarium which is also just next door.

"Hotel Elysee is a great hotel. My husband loves to stay at the Carlyle, but this was a leisure not business trip so we opted for less expensive accommodations. The room was one of their standard rooms, but with a terrace. Very nice. The bed and linens were gorgeous, the bathroom was beautiful. We will stay here again for sure.

"I recently stayed at the Aloft Phoenix as I needed a place close to the airport. For what I was looking for and for a reasonable price, It was very clean, wdesigned to have a W style vibe on smaller scale (in fact, even the bath products were Bliss but smaller containers and the shampoo and body wash in the shower were the industrial, refillable type which I thought went a little too far in trying to cut costs). The room was small, and had built in wall ac which was a bit noisy but the bed was very comfortable so I slept well despite the airport noise.

"The Quincy Hotel is located in downtown Washington DC in the heart of the financial district., just two blocks from Metro stations. Our room was was nicely appointed in a modern style. It was kept very clean. A small kitchen was part of the room; full sized refrigerator, full stove plus microwave oven. The bathroom was well appointed and also very clean. We found the bed comfortable. The room had two closets - his and hers!
The staff was friendly and helpful. There was a little confusion that I had used their website to extend our stay but the front desk did not have the updated information. Fortunately, room was available and there was no trouble extending our stay.
Our room was somewhat warmer than we would have liked and there was no way to cool it down. Both wireless and wired internet service was available at no cost and worked just fine. A copy of the Washington Post appeared at out door every morning.

"Before I begin my review, I want to say that this hotel's service and facilities were MUCH nicer than One Washington Circle, where I had stayed for two days before arriving at this hotel. The decor of the Washington Terrace Hotel is much nicer and the staff is friendlier and more helpful.
When I first arrived at the hotel, the bellmen were slow to help us with our bags, by the time he came out of the lobby, we were already at the door. Right inside another woman was loudly complaining that she had stayed at very nice hotels before and that this hotel's concierge was the worst she had ever encountered. Not a very good first impression! However, I had no problems with the concierge when I asked the to help me find a restaurant I wanted to go to for lunch.
I came back to check in and the only front desk agent on duty was on the phone. I waited patiently then remarked that it must be difficult to both answer phones and serve at the person checking guests into the hotel. (I sympathize with hotel employees since I am a student in hotel administration and have worked in line level positions as well) He agreed and then proceeded to look up my reservation. The Deluxe King room I had requested was unavailable, and he asked if I would mind a stand-up shower. I wasn't sure what he meant, I thought he meant a room with shower stall only. I asked if I could switch rooms the next day if unhappy and he said with a wink that of course I could, but I wouldn't want to since it was a very nice room. 
Turns out he had upgraded us to a suite with a full living room with pull-out couch, two televisions, marble wetbar, HUGE bathroom with marble flooring, a beautiful shower curtain, and well lit bathroom counter area. According to the hotel website I thought all the beds were Tempur-Pedic, this bed was not, but had a very comfortable pillow top mattress and tons of pillows. 
Housekeeping did a great job, everything looked great. I really liked the small details like the Bath & Body Works products in the bathroom and how the housekeeping arranged a small fan on the edge of the bathtub.
My only complaint is that this room was right next to the elevator (probably because it is handicapped accessible) and if you were sitting in the living room you could hear the faint """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""ding"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" noise made when people using the elevator arrived at the floor.",happy

"I've stayed at the Wardman several times for conferences, and as long as the conference is based here, I'll continue to stay mainly due to the convenience factor. Recent stay, however, more glitches-issues than I recalled from last time including screwed up bill (which in fairness, was straightend out), housekeeping issues, and about the weakest, most luke-warm shower ever. Others have commented on Internet cost, I agree but it is a reality of most convention hotels. They do have free wifi and some dedicated terminals in the bar which is a plus. Convenience to Metro, a few decent restaurants, Adams Morgan a nice walk away, National Zoo (if you bring the kids) is also walkable are also pluses. Convention facilities are nice, decent and easily accessed. Room was only OK, bed was confortable, but no blanket-comforter was a (negative) surprise. Small fridge in room, however, was a positive surprise. -nd floor room had no view whatsoever, blocked by roof of attached convention space. Bathroom was small, to much flow restriction on shower and water didn't get hot enough for my taste. Housekeeping was problematic, room was clean enough, but mold on inside of shower curtain, week-old newspaper in drawer, makes me question how thoroughly it was cleaned.
As I said, I'll stay here the next time the conference is in town as the alternative (--- mile away at the Hilton) is worse than the issues here.",not happy
"This hotel is lovely. Very reasonably priced about - blocks from the empire state building. The room was pretty big and very clean with a nice bathroom. They had free hot drinks and cookies in the lobby and also free internet access. It was kind of like a nice travelodge. The staff were very friendly and when we checked out they locked away our backpacks for us for the entire day free of charge so we didnt have to carry them around all day. We did however but a sign on our door that we did not want room service but they came in anyway when we werent there. 
Overall i would recommend this hotel, it was clean and very nice!",happy
"We have stayed in Hiltons all over the world and this one was a great disappointment. The location and view were fantastic, however, they didn't make up for everything else. We booked the 'romance package' on a high floor with a Coronado-Bay view. We had to request our 'complimentary' champagne twice and there was no bath tub - just a shower. When we called to request a change to a room with a tub, we were told that there are no king corner rooms with a Coronado-Bay view and a bath tub in the entire hotel. There is also no executive floor or lounge. Most of the restaurants (including Starbucks) are only accessible by exiting the hotel and walking around the side (outdoors). Quite inconvenient at -:-- am. Also, the reviewer who said the decor reminded him of an ikea showroom was spot on - sterile, cold, not welcoming at all. We will not stay at this hotel again!",not happy
"Short but sweet. The cleanliness is excellent, we didn't like the night waitress and shower stopper didn't work. So my husband and I couldn't take a hot bath together. When my husband took a shower he had to unscrew the stopper just to take a shower because then it stopped up the water!!! what the hell? We will not ever stay there again!",not happy
"The previous reviewer said it best - don't freak out! I also booked a room on priceline and after reading some terrible reviews on a few different sites I was quite nervous about staying at this hotel. I was travelling for business, and was worried that I would not have a restful stay. I am happy to say I was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel!
I arrived at ---am hoping to just drop off my bags and the staff checked me into a room right then which was a great surprise! My room was small (especially the bathroom), but very clean. You can certainly tell this is an old hotel by the room doors (old wooden doors) and the fact there are no closets, but the Park plaza has put some nice furniture in the room that subsitutes well. My bed was super comfortable, and the hotel was very, very quiet (and I was next to a stairwell!). I did not have any of the problems of earlier reviewers hearing others tvs, having noisy heater fans, etc. The rooms do not have much by way of ammenities (no coffee makers, fridge - minibar, wifi, etc), but where my stay was only - nights, these issues did not effect me much. I did use the high speed internet service while at the hotel which was sufficient.
All staff I encountered were very pleasant and helpful. It was hit or miss whether or not there was a doorman or bell captain to help with your bags.
The location was excellent just - blocks from Boston Common and Newbury Street, and a few blocks from the theatre district. I was able to walk to all of my destinations, and there are many great places to eat nearby too.
Overall, I would stay here again if travelling alone. I would not choose this hotel if travelling with a family as the rooms are quite small. Also, I would not choose this hotel if I was travelling for leisure as my own personal preference would be to want some of the ammenties the Boston Park Plaza rooms did not have.However, for a few nights of business travel, the Park Plaza was great, with a great location and even better price!",not happy
"The location of this hotel is outstanding! It is right across from a Metro station and - blocks from the White House and other major sites. The hotel itself was an excellent value especially for its location. Our room was clean and very comfortable. The walls were kind of thin and we could hear the baby that was staying next door, but we live in an apartment in downtown Chicago so we aren’t really bothered by noise. The room was kind of small, but we had a queen sized bed and plenty of room for two people. The staff was very courteous and helpful. They even got us a cab at -:-- in the morning so we could catch our flight. Considering the low price, we were impressed with the features like a nice fitness center, complimentary bottled water, high speed internet, and high definition television in the rooms. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to DC.",happy
"This was the first night of our trip which was booked as part of a tour. We arrived quite late having flown from Chicago, so wanted to get checked in - easier said than done! They had no idea which group we were joining - so kept sending us of to different people who had no idea what we were talking about. When we finally got a room we wanted to cry as it was just horrible! The first thing you noticed as you got out of the lift was the smell, smoke filled the corridors. We managed to find our room even though there were no signs, as the room smelt like an ash-tray, we called down to reception to ask for a non-smoking room we were then informed it was a non-smoking room! They did send a maid up to spray air freshner - but nearly chocked on the sheer amount. There were some facilities eg. microwave, fridge and - mugs that you would never dream of drinking anything out of! as for the bathroom it was filthy, you would have to have another shower after using the towels! No-one in there right mind would of taken there shoes off either unless you wanted to stick to the carpet!! we thought that we would just go to bed as we had to get up early in the morning .. easier said than done .. every time you moved the smell of smoke came out of the bedding! 
We were suposed to return to this same hotel on the last night of our tour, so went to reception to see if we could pay more to be upgraded to another room, they were rude and unhelpful, and not prepared to do a thing. 
Lucky we managed to get booked into the Essex House hotel round the corner, as we could not have faced another night in this ---- hole. 
Totally disgusting, if anyone is thinking of going there please do not waste your money on this hotel when you can get something a lot better for not much more.",not happy
"I stayed at the Peabody for a conference and was disappointed at several turns with facilities and service.
First, let me say that the lobby and ballrooms are lovely and evocative of Versailles. Do not leave the lobby as it truly goes downhill from there.
The hotel was overbooked and gave our group smoking rooms. I don't smoke, but am not an obsessive anti-smoker and usually have no problem in this situation. THESE ROOMS WERE VILE! The smoke smell was unbelievably oppressive. No one had attempted to air it, Febreze it or even spray a bit of Glade. For the days I was there, I avoided my room until absolutely ready to sleep, as did my travel mates.
Check out was at --AM, and we were giving a presentation from -----:-- and asked for a noon check-out. They would not accommodate us, so we had to drag our luggage down to the bellman and after we presented, we lugged it down (stairs) into the changing rooms in the basement-level fitness center. I travel a great deal and rarely request late check-out, but have not had such a direct refusal.
Beware of extra charges. The hotel imposes service fees for your stay on top of the room fee and taxes. Also, in the coffee shop, I was overcharged. I asked for cappuccino, but the machine was broken. That did not stop the young women for charging me cappuccino price for a regular coffee. 
As others have mentioned, if you do not valet park, you will be traveling a considerable distance through many heavy doors. I would suggest using the valet if you are forced to stay here b-c this is the venue chosen by your company or professional assn. As one collegue put it, it was probably a four star """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""in the day,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but no longer.",not happy
"I must say, for the amount of travel I do for my job, I generally have good luck with the hotels that I stay in. Unfortunately, I cannot say that for the L'enfant Plaza. From the moment I checked in, I had issues. 
I ended up checking in at about --:-- in the evening - upon receiving my room key, I proceeded to my room on the top floor of the hotel. Upon entering my room, it sounded as though they booked me in the engine room of a cruise ship - the room was extremely loud, and I suspect that the air conditioning unit for the entire hotel was directly above this room. 
Knowing I wouldn't get a wink of sleep if I stayed in this room, I proceeded back to the front desk where I was told that the only room available was a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""parlor"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" room. If you've read some of the other reviews of this hotel, you will immediately know that this is actually a room that doesn't have a bed. Wonderful... So my choices are the engine room or a room without an actual bed. I chose the latter....
Up to this room I headed.... The room was quite large, with a dining table that sat at least - people. The carpets were stained in multiple areas, and there were a number of cobwebs on the light fixtures. Again - I'm not too pleased with the room, but they had promised to move me to an actual room the following day. Since I was tired, and the only thing that they'd end up doing for me is putting me in another parlor room, I sucked it up and stayed in this room.
To the hotel's credit, they did move me to a suitable room the following day and did comp me a breakfast in their restaurant. The room that I ended up in after the first night was clean, but as many others have commented, this place needs a significant remodeling - the place reminded me of a late ----'s Marriott.
I was attending a conference at this hotel, and must also mention two things. First of all, the first day of the meeting, the air conditioning in the conference room was not working sufficiently. Many in attendance were visibly uncomfortable from the heat and humidity (myself included) - it made it difficult to concentrate. Also, the cellular and wifi signals in the conference rooms are non-existent. When you exit the room, the signal is fine in the foyer, but poor in the actual room. This made it difficult for me because I had a couple of calls I was expecting, so I found myself nervously exiting the room regularly.
One last experience I must mention... On the second night, I visited the bar and had a couple of drinks. When ready to retire for the evening, I asked for the bill and noticed that I was overcharged by one drink. When I brought it to the attention of the bartender, I was met with arguing that I did, in fact, have the drink in question. I like to consider myself a trustworthy person, and for the bartender to argue with me and question my truthfulness was an insult to me. I wasn't trying to scam him out of money, nor would it have been any skin off his back to just correct the bill. Knowing that I wasn't getting anywhere, I ended up just paying for the extra drink and leaving a lousy tip. He argued his way out of his tip.....
If I ever have to attend a meeting at this hotel in the future, I will probably stay elsewhere and use the Metro to get to the L'enfant - the Metro is actually conveniently located under the hotel, which makes getting around town quite convenient.
My recommendation - stay away from the L'enfant Plaza Hotel until significant changes are made to this property.",not happy
"We had to attend a family wedding in New York City, so we had our three children with us. Frankly, very few hotels in NYC would allow more than four guests in a suite. Comes the Ritz Carlton Battery Park.
The service and amenities were nothing short of excellent. We were there for - nights and each shift greeted us by name, and remembered the names of our children. One evening, the doorman helped us carry our sleeping children from the taxi to our suite!!!
We have family in the city, so have stayed many times in NYC. Never stayed at the tip of the island. After this hotel, we will never stay in mid-town. The view of the harbour was beautiful. The children were thrilled, and so therefore were we.",happy

The location of the Hilton is well situated and the BART is nearby.
For such an expensive hotel it would be very simple to offer free WiFi instead of charging $--.--.

"After reading other reviews we were a little worried about our visit , however we found the hotel name very apt, you really are in paradise. The resort is a tropical oasis with very good standard accomodation and excellant staff. We certainly did not have any problem with service or ants in the room.
The only slight downside was the maid service, although very thorough the room was often not serviced until -.--pm. The bayside grill is excellant and in a lovely setting. We did also have an excellant meal at the Balleen restaurant, but this was quite expensive, especially for children and the added service charge, the coffee at $- dollars was expensive.
The resort is situated ideally for the old town and the Gaslamp Quarter and only a mile from Seaworld.

"Stayed here for three days on business and found the hotel to be very nice. I got a room at the back, end of the building, which allowed a larger , comfortable room. The staff was extremely attentive. The hotel has a very nice, older world anbaince. The bar is like a fabulous old men's club - heavy paneling, sumptuous sofas and low lighting - very, very nice place to work during the day when the bar is closed. Although it may be a personal taste thing; and older couple walked through while I was there and I heard the elderly gentleman say, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""This is like a funeral parlour""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""!

"Pricelined this hotel for a quick city overnight. Very happy with location, walking distance to South Street Seaport, Battery Park, and the Staten Island Ferry (free boatride!). Also right down the street from a delightful cobblestoned section of restaurants and bars, also on Stone Street, heading East. The street is blocked and has community tables in the middle, very European! (Hint: there is a building standing in the middle of Stone, you have to walk around it.). Hotel itself is small, yo they have very few doubles, but you can ask for a king. NO ROLLAWAYS...we brought a rolled up foam mat for my son and used the extra pillows and down comforter from the closet. Hot chocolate chip cookies on check-in; very clean room with a huge flatscreen and four HBO channels, really helpful staff down to the guys at the door, and simply everyone else. Free internet on three computers in the lobby, no charge to hold your bags in storage. There's a Chipotle across the street and the Native American Museum, nearby, is free. Downside: Elevators can be slow, but were generally quick and the continental breakfast isn't free for some room levels (we went for a diner one day, fast food the next). Really enjoyed our stay!",happy
"I just go back home from a perfect stay at the chandler Inn in Boston. If you are planning a trip to Boston you can't beat this hotel value for money. 
After a rough first night at a room on the first floor the accommodating staff was happy to move me to another room which was excellent.
The hotel is renovated very tastefully, the location is awesome,I were able to walk EVERYWHERE and I found the pricing to be very low for a new boutique hotel in the center of Boston. The staff was patience and attentive and always willing to go the extra mile in order to help.",happy
"I was looking forward to staying here based on the photos and reviews, and went out of my way to get a night here (I was suggested somewhere else by my company). Great location and spacious rooms. But I found the service to be very slow (i asked for some items from housekeeping and ended up having to go down and get it myself!). They do not provide basic amenities (toothbrushes, razors) for free - when you call housekeeping they just connect you to their souvenir shop! 
There is a rooftop pool and (supposedly) an excellent gym, but guests need to pay for access, which i thought was stingy and it defeated the purpose of my move to this hotel (this was not mentioned on their site). I checked out the pool but it looked much smaller than expected and it was full of kids so I didn't bother in the end (the pool was one of the reasons I picked the hotel!!)
The killer moment for me was when I was getting ready to go to bed, having been up for nearly -- hours after my travels. I was about to take a shower and saw hairs in the tub! I called the front desk to complain and they said they would send someone up to help me move within - mins - but I ended up waiting or ages and having to call them repeatedly (v frustrating when you're exhausted). In the end I was given a new key and did not even get help moving my stuff! To be fair the new room was much bigger but I still think this should never have happened in the first place. I can't believe I had to pay for this night after all the inconvenience. The hotel does not seem to care for its customers!",not happy

"Part of a --week family holiday in the US.
Stayed for - nights in early August and booked direct with hotel. 
First night: although we specifically asked for a high-floor, we ended up on the second floor, bar side. This is because, of course, this is not really a hotel but a time-share with occasional availability of rooms and the part-owners want the best rooms. Nothing wrong with that, but the room was not good. Spartan, worn down (reminded me of Eastern European hotels in the --s) and VERY noisy given pubs across the street. -*. Fortunately staff at reception managed to move us to the --th floor the second night: what a difference. Fantastic room, great furnishings, spectacular views.... -*.
In the end we were grateful for the swap and appreciate they were under no obligation to move us but the difference was spectacular and for $--- a night the room on the -nd floor was a joke. 
Great top floor 'games' room behind the clock in this famous Boston landmark though. Breakfast was mediocre and a bit weird as room was too small, historic as it was.
Overall, I would not stay here again as there is no guarantee of a nice vs rubbish room and overall a mixed experience.
Next, off Cape Ann but next hotel was Comfort Inn in Concord.",not happy

"After staying at the Beverly Inn I would have to say that I agree with all of the other reviews I have read, both good and bad. We stayed there for - days. This place was recommended by The Price Is Right website. We still aren't sure why though. When we checked in it was - AM. There was no one at the front desk and we had to ring the doorbell for about -- minutes before anyone came to the desk. The man that came to the desk had obviously been sleeping in the back room(it was the owner) and was not wearing shoes or socks. He was a bit annoyed with us that we were checking in earlier than we had previously thought. After we got to our room, we discovered that the room we had thought we were booking with two queen size beds had only one queen and one full. The phone's apparent place was on the back of the couch. And there was carpet pulled up on the side of one of the beds. When my dad laid down to go to sleep, his headboard from the bed fell over on him. I was a bit thrown off when I was in the midst of a shower and discovered that the motel does not provide complimentary shampoo or conditioner. 
The layout of the motel is very Beverly Hills. The architecture of the Inn was nice. It was -- degrees in L.A. and the pool was not heated. So even though a pool was advertised, it is outside and was not usable while we were there due to the weather. There is an ice machine on the -st floor which requires -- cents to use. Ice buckets are available upon request. So when we went to request one, we were told the ice machine had broken down earlier that day. 
When we arrived we even found a lovely hair in one of our beds, however, while we were there, the room got cleaned pretty well. There was actually a couple of times that the hot water seemed to be running short. And the walls were paper thin. It was possible to hear other occupants in their rooms. 
Their website said they did not provide breakfast, so we were pleasantly surprised when we found that coffee and honeybun type pastries had been sat out in the main lobby on a couple of mornings. 
We made this trip strictly for a Price is Right experience. So under this premise, we found the motel very lacking in some areas, yet quite sufficient for the price that close to Hollywood and Beverly Hills. I would be more than happy to answer any questions anyone might have about this motel or TPIR.",not happy

The room is on the smaller side but it was clean and had everything I needed, including free internet. Will definitely stay here again in the future.",happy
"Beautiful Hotel, Awesome view, courteous staff. Room was very very large, and well furnished. The tub was just what you need after a long day. Close to many place to shop and have a great meal.Room service a bit on the pricey side. Nice Spa service offered as well. Would stay there again.",happy
"Located on Rhode Island Ave. at the intersection of Massachusetts Ave., this hotel has heavy street traffic and considerable street noise. It is convenient to Dupont Circle (--- blocks away), but other hotels are equally convenient, quieter, and better priced.

There are only - elevators to service multiple stores, and when I stayed there in June ---- only one was working.

The room was very clean and stocked with plenty of towels and the usual toiletries.
I loved the roof. One is invited to bring your own drink to the indoor-outdoor carpeted roof where there are tables and chairs. The --- degree views of the city are absolutely incomparable. It was a serene, beautiful place for a nightcap.
Front desk personnel were always friendly, engaging and eager to help with directions. The elevators are unique and original. Perhaps they are a little challenging. The hotel is only ten floors and I was on the fifth. Lazy me would take the elevator up to my room or the roof and then take the stairs down. The hallways are completed with a thick, luxurious carpet that are easy to walk on and absorbing of sound. I kept my window open at night because I enjoyed listening to the city in the evening. Free wireless in my room was appreciated.
This hotel is easy walking distance to the convention center, Petco Park, Horton Plaza, bars and restaurants. I really enjoyed the Ramada as a business traveler.",happy

"Just returned from a one night stay at the Westin waterfront. I would have liked to give this a -.-, but I will give this hotel the benefit of an added half-star in lieu of one less. For us, however, this was a great all around experience.
First, we went to this hotel for a one night romantic getaway- we recently got married, but havent had time for a honeymoon so it was just a brief getaway from our house which is probably only - miles away. The Westin provided a great escape. Here's a breakdown of the things I noticed.
-The lobby is huge, with a modern decor, and a open lobby bar. However despite being a very modern theme, the use of live birch trees, dark wood, and vibrant art makes it feel comfortable and not cold. This is not your typical Boston hotel, and that is one of the reasons I wanted to stay here.
- Our room was the standard size and for Boston, I have to say it was quite large. The bathroom was unremarkable, although the mirror was fantastic- it was surrounded by a light making it easy for putting on makeup, etc. The TV was a LG -- inch HD, and the picture and sound were fantastic. The selection of channels was better than most hotel rooms, and most channels were in HD. Our view was actually pretty great even though we didn't pay for a room with a view- it is an interesting perspective of Boston from that location, and we enjoyed just watching our city. The window was the entire wall. The furnishings in the room continue the modern but almost nature-feel with warm, earthy tones. The heavenly bed was, as always, heavenly.
-The workout facility was spotless with all brand new equipment. The treadmills were far better than at my own gym. The pool was small, but clean, and the hot-tub was, strangely, metal.
-Dining- we had drinks in the Birch Bar in the lobby- expensive cocktails, but the friendly bartender gave us a round for free. We had the Sea Salt french fries and they were soooo good. You get to choose a few sauces that come from the restaurant, Sauciety. I definitely recommend the Whiskey Spiked Ketchup. We ate dinner and breakfast in the room. Dinner was actually great, and for room-service in Boston, reasonably priced. Breakfast on the other hand, was the downside. VERY expensive ($-- for the standard American Breakfast). The eggs were watery and weird, and the pancakes were salty. It was included in our rate, so we werent that dissapointed. 
-Service. We had simply outstanding service all around. My husband mentioned that we were there for a special occassion, and when we returned to our room from the Birch Bar, we found a bottle of expensive champagne and a plate of four delicious chocolate desserts. Room service was prompt, and when we requested extra pillows, they were there in under - minutes. The bartender downstairs was great, and check-in and check out were efficient.
So the bottom line- I would not recommend this hotel for tourists because of the location, though if you get a good rate, I would go for it. Also, in warmer months, it really wouldnt be that bad to walk places. We paid --- for the room which included in room breakfast and a -pm checkout. The Starwood website often includes great rates, especially last minute, but it helps to know how to navigate it. However, there have regularly been affordable rates, even as low as ---. Either of these is a steal for Boston. I would strongly recommend this hotel for locals looking for a getaway, others looking for a more quiet location, and certainly for conventioners. It wasn't quite perfect b-c of the breakfast, and the bathroom could have been a bit larger. Nonetheless, this is a great Westin property.",happy
"just before i checked in i freaked out a bit after reading some of the less positive reviews about fluctuating water temperatures and noise. but i didn't experience any of those problems. i got a great rate from booking.com and i couldn't have been more pleased. great double bed, hardwood floors, flat screen and it was extremely clean! plus, you can't beat the free wi-fi or the location. the herald square, is by far, the best deal in midtown. i'll stay again and again.",happy
"Durring our stay I will say that the rooms were very clean. Yet there were nothing but issues from the start with the front desk staff. The first said she made our reservation, even giving me a confirmation number, which when we tried to look up, turned out to be false. Then, the air conditioning in our room failed, and the staff refused to move us even though they were virtually empty. When I spoke to the manager, he yelled at me claiming I was out of line to think I deserved to be relocated. Not only were we lied to by the staff, but also screamed at by them. Then, when it was time to check out, the front desk staff did not know how to do a manual check out when the computer system was down. All around, an unpleasant experience.",not happy
"We stayed at the Handlery last weekend, Nov. --, ----. We booked straight from their website and got a great rate. We had a standard King room. The room was TINY. Our view was a dirty alley with a brick wall. The cleanliness in the room was not the greatest, but the bed was very comfortable. Not too many channels on the tv either, and we had a --"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tv. The pool area was great. If you stay at this hotel, you MUST get a poolside room as they looked the nicest. We didn't spend much time in the room, so it turned out okay. I was very disappointed. Our room looked nothing like the pics on the website. There was definitely a stuffy-old smell in our room. The water pressure in the shower was not too bad. I would not recommend the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""historic"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""standard"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" rooms in this hotel, but I would happily stay there again, but in an upgraded or poolside room. The staff was friendly, as was the concierge. 
The location was the BEST part of this hotel. Great food and shops within blocks. We took the BART from the airport and had to walk only two blocks to this hotel.",not happy
My husband and I stayed here for - nights. The room was clean and comfortable. The furniture was a bit dates but for the price and location it's a great deal! The hotel offers free covered parking which can be hard to find and is only about a - block walk to Union Street which has plenty of shops and restaurants. I would definately recommend this place.,happy

"We stayed at the Conrad in Indianapolis last year, and expected the same level of luxury and opulence at the Conrad in Chicago. While the service and personnel where helpful and kind, the room (a suite, of all things) didn't feel quite as grand and luxurious as I had come to expect from a hotel in this class. I can't find fault with anything specific, but I just found this Conrad to be wanting in terms of the guest experience, the decor of its rooms, and that """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""step above"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" touch that distinguishes nice from superb. Bottom line, I would probably stay at the Sofitel in Chicago rather than the Conrad, even if i'm a Hilton Honor member.",not happy
"My wife and I spent a night at the Hilton last weekend after arriving in New York from South Africa. The hotel generously stored our luggage as we arrived so early in the morning. They also allowed us to check in early in the afternoon. The room was a bit small, but not unexpected for New York. The location was good and served us well as we had some serious shopping to do in the garment district!",happy
"When my cousin's decided that we would stay at the Waldorf for our - night in the city, I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews (especially since this was the final leg of a long trip from San Diego). 
However, the Waldorf exceeded every expectation. The lobby is beautiful, staff attentive and kind and our room had high ceilings, fireplace, view of the city, granite bathroom and every amenity. Our room was in the Waldorf Tower - so if you go, you may want to request that section.
It was my cousin's anniversary - and they comped us all breakfast at Oscars in the hotel - which was great. 
The hotel is centrally located - within walking distance to everywhere. And yet quiet - which is a definite plus in the city that never sleeps! 
All in all - a grand hotel!!",happy
"This hotel boasts a great location, however I found it to be completely unremarkable. I have stayed at many an embassy suite or residence inn that was nicer and higher end, at a lower rate. The lobby-lounge, although a nice sitting area, the bar was not open during our - day-weekend stay. The room was simple, the bathroom, nothing special (again, chain hotels have had higher end baths than this. No fan-vent in the bathroom, so it steams-heats up quick. There is a sitting vanity area outside the bathroom, which is nice for couples, however not with a sink. The stylish framed mirror they have mounted on the wall at the vanity, although looks nice in the space design-wise, when sitting enables you to only see the top hairs of your head (I am -'-""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""). Not sure what the point of that is. The beds are too soft and feel cheap, and the every pillow (out of perhaps - on the bed) were lumpy and very uncomfortable. You'd think being a spa hotel, pillows, bedding, towels, etc, would be a priority. (I've stayed at a Howard Johnsons with better beds and pillows) The walls are thin, you hear everything going on with your neighbors and up and down the halls. If you are staying here, get a room with a lake view. This is the only saving grace of the place. However, being a resort, on the lake, you'd think there would be some kind of walkway or path ALONG the lake. Our morning run required snaking through the neighborhood sidewalks with absolutely no view of water at all. If it weren't for the view, I wouldn't bother to stay here, and I certainly would not pay full price. Just not worth it. We won't be back.",not happy
My wife and I and our little puppy Davey were here inJanuary at which time we received just the best customer service ever in our travels. Kim was our host at that time. Today I checked back into the Red Roof and Kim was there at the front desk waiting for me again. She was friendly and professional and even booked me into the same room we had last time. I really felt like it was a sort of coming home. Great job Kim! Great job Red Roof for hiring her!!,happy
"We stayed at the Renoir for the weekend in mid May ----. We booked it due to the cheap rates as it was the first stop on a - month round the world trip. 
The hotel itself is a little bit dated but everything works, the staff are very friendly and helpful, there is a coffee-hot chocolate machine in the foyer for $-.-- a drink. No wi fi and the internet in the hotel foyer is quite expensive- $- for -- mins and then you pretty much pay by the second!
The room was quite larger compared to many others that we have since stayed in and the bed was huge!
We would happily stay there again if the hotel was in a different area! Whilst it is conveniently located on the tram line (market street) close to a train station and within quick walking distance to Union square, it seems to be a haven for the homeless and there was a constant smell of pot and urine in the air. We were never approached by anyone but did hang on to our bags when walking through and made sure that if were returning to the hotel on foot we would be back before dark or catch a cab and never went out solo (particularly myself being female).
Its a comfortable hotel, good value for money",not happy
"We stayed here on a friday night in one of the executive king rooms for a romantic getaway. The room had a couch and a big bathtub for two. Room was very nice. Flat screen was good. Bed was firm. You can tell this is a new hotel. The restaurant is also very good for food, but even more for martinis and some appetizers in the bar on a friday night, though it can be crowded. BEWARE Dupont is a very gay friendly neighborhood. Stopping in at the Fireplace Bar around the corner is not for everyone! 
The bad side is the heating system was messed up. The engineer came twice but really couldnt make cool air come out. We actually had to open the door for a bit to get cool air from teh hallway into the room. But sleeping was not uncomfortable. 
Room service was also a mess. They showed up an hour late, and had to make multiple trips because they kept forgetting things. Check your food before the waiter leaves!
After waiting for breakfast until about --:--, the front desk said they could not extend check-out past -pm. So I checked out at -pm, then went back to the room to shower and relax until the maid came in a -pm to fix up the room. Never believe the front desk when they say you cant stay longer!",happy
"I have stayed with the other Affinia hotels and have always had a great experience. I was expecting the same level of rooms as the other hotels. 
Let me first say that the Eastgate Tower's staff was courteous, professional and extremely accomodating. The hotel itself is in a great neighborhood and very convenient to many sites. 
BUT The hotel is extremely outdated and its decor looks like it is from the ----'s. The beds were uncomfortable and the pull out sofa's mattress was almost nonexistent. We had to pile two sofa mattresses on top of each other for it to be decent. The rooms had a funky smell and the bathrooms were all white but looked yellow. I would rate our overall stay as just okay. I will not be returning until they update this hotel.",not happy
"the staff was very friendly, but expedia had not forwardered my change of days so fortuinelly i had taken my confermation with me and completed the check-in. the accomidations were very gooe, towels were large and new not thread bare. the kitcjen was well stocked with tools, but there was no dish soap so had to go to mal-mart across the street.
 complaint the refg. door needed to be reversed was right swing and needed to be left as you had to walk around the door when getting things out of refg. also the cable on the dishwasher door was brokne so when you opened the door had to be very careful not to let it drop on your toes. other than that it was very good convenient to rest, shopping and interstate. so would go back , we were in the handicapped suite, would liked to have """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""king"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" bed, only one queen",happy

"I visited this crap hole with my family. If the kids weren't so tired I'd never stayed until morning! Bath was nasty and water trapped under the plastic tube it a hazard. The water pushes up the tub, like standing on a waterbed. Very dangerous!!! The water that gushes up when you stand in the tub is putrid. Had to put a towel at the door to avoid the odor. Never again.",not happy
"We booked the romance package at omni.com which includes a pre-visit phone call from the concierge. She called a few days prior to our visit and was very helpful and accommodating to my requests. When we arrived, we loved the tasteful Texas decor and the feel of the hotel. We received an upgrade so ended up in a beautiful suite. Everything that comes with the romance package was set up in our room. I also joined the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""omni select"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" memership online, which also has a few extra perks, and we received all of those as well, just as promised.

"Attended for a trade show. Hotel handled our incoming packages for the conference smoothly. 
Everything here was nice and large scale. - Tiers of elevators make getting to your hotel floor more quickly.
Rooms were well appointed for business and roomy. Bathrooms seemed to be recently remodeled. Very comfortable bed.
The work desk was set up right in front of the window for a beautiful work space. I was on the --th floor (out of --) so I could not see the bay from my room, but it was still a beautiful view!",happy
Stayed a couple of days on business. The room was spacious and very nice. Not sure I've ever checked into a hotel quicker...they had a packet ready with all my stuff. Didn't even need to run my card. Even stuck in a $-- Starbucks gift card. Is in a nice neighborhood with interesting restaurants and easy access to the metro. Will be my destination of choice for any future trips to DC.,happy
"I was in town on business, and the location was great for visiting a federal agency. The room was very clean and spacious, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I have seen some reviews criticizing the continental breakfast, but I thought it was good--coffiee, juice, fruit, muffins, croissants, and toast. I would definitely stay here again without hesitation",happy
"As this was a first time visit to NYC we wanted to stay in the middle of Manhatten and in a hotel which offered a range of comfort and facilities. Thus we chose the Intercontinental Barclay from the hotels on offer from the travel agent. We booked the accommodation late on and so were a little restricted as to availability. 
The location is great - just off Lexington Ave and the hotel looks grand enough. Don't expect warm personal service unless you are very grand, it's quite anonymous and the desk staff and polite but reserved. 
The room was small and although the quality of fixtures was good, there was a price on everything. One even got the impression that should you be a little over zealous with the shampoo you would be charged for more!
I could honestly say that the hotel was no better than a good Holiday Inn or a Marriott - you pay for the location of course. Our view was of the scaffolding on the Radisson opposite and the wall of the hotel next door but I guess that was to be expected. 
The ground floor restaurant served good quality food and was not too excessively priced. It was always possible to get a cab from outside the hotel. The porters were helpful and polite. 
In summary, there is nothing wrong with this hotel, it just doesn't have any wow factor. Then again - being where it is - does it need it?",not happy
"I don't agree with all the negative posting about this property. My girlfriend and I stayed two night at this hotel, paid about --$ (including taxes!!!) per night, thanks to one of those booklets you get at gas stations along the highway. 
Room was at second floor facing the pool, everything was really clean, pool was nice a little heated. Staff were ok. 
At --$ per night this is the best bargain of all our US roadtrip. 
Can't recommend it enough, we stayed at Days Inn or Motel - for a higher rate and got worse rooms.",happy
"We stayed at this hotel during a very busy weekend. The hotel hosted the Green Bay Packers, tons of very devoted fans, and held two Marine Anniversary Balls. The staff did a very good job accomodating sooo many people and keeping the lines short. We received a notice telling us it was going to be very busy and what to do to speed the check out process up, etc. 
Suprisingly, some of the Concierge help was only OK. Better than other hotels, but not as good as some other Hiltons or other better hotels. Although, they were very polite, they didn't offer information. Since we had never been to San Diego, we could have used more help. For instance, when I asked for a map, I was given one which seemed fine. I only realized later it was a only a portion of the area. When I went back the next day, and pointed to other maps and asked """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""what's that of?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""", I then received a color map with restaurants-landmarks highlighted and - other black and white maps. Much better.
The hotel is right next to the Convention Center but on the far side. It was about a --- minute walk to the Gaslight District and less to Petco Baseball Park. Some hotels are right in the District, which means tons of restaurants, a cup of coffee, a drink are all at your doostep. Prrobably no water view though. I would check out the Hyatt if we went again....it would be on the water and right across from District. I would also consider Hilton in the Gaslight District. The BayFront Hilton has very limited restaraunt choices.",happy
"My wife and I stayed at the RIM of -- nights in June ----, when we left my wife forgot a hair straightener on the room window edge along with a Japanese Plant not more - inches long that our daughter gave her - years ago, very huge sentimental value.
We called the same day and drove back the next day and drove back again - days later and they all brushed us off saying they will investigate and call you.
No one called, no one cared, very poor room service ethics. Never again Marriot",not happy
"After dropping a rental car down the road we walked up to the hotel & were pretty concerned at the dealers hanging around on the street.
The lift seems a little out of date but the room although small was fine, not the cleanest but better than many places I have stayed. There is no AC and the window didnt open, there was a fan but our room was still very hot.
Nervously walked around the corner to get dinner before it got dark & went back to our room. We decided that we werent comfortable walking around the couple of blocks this hotel is in and booked somewhere closer to the square. Its amazing the difference a couple of blocks make. Spent one night here and left early in the morning, walking - blocks away feels much safer. This may be our perceived risk but we felt much happier away from this area. The concierge at the next hotel told us to avoid the Tenderloin so we laughed! Walking around the rest of SF was great.",not happy
"My Husband and I stayed here for - nights over Valentines day, our room was on the third floor, didn't have a fantastic view but wasn't awful. The room itself was lovely, spacious and clean. The bathroom was also a fair size and spotless. 
We did hear some construction noise from the left of the hotel in the mornings and also deliveries to the hotel as we were above the loading bay. 
The staff we encountered were friendly and happy to help. 
We ate in the Stanhope Grille for breakfast and for valentines day, the food was very nice, and the price was very reasonable for what you got. 
Cuff's seems to be the place to be, the bar was always packed and sometimes a little to noisy we went and sat upstairs in the hotel bar. 
The location of this hotel is excellant, everything is within walking distance. 
On the whole we had a fantastic time in Boston and we certainly come back here again.",happy
i had handicapped family and they put us in the very end of the hallway. we stayed on -nd floor the ice machine didnt work. the hallways were extremely dark and the hotel smelled like dog urine and wet dog. our room was pretty dark even with curtains open. the carpets and bedspreads had cigarette burns all over. the refrigerator made a terrible sound at night. i found small roaches in the bathroom. and asked for deoderizer to be sprayed in the room while we were gone. that didnt happen. i needed to use the business center and had to argue to get the key for it on - occasions. the dayshift had given me a receipt with password for it and the night shift says we know nothing about it. they finally gave in & gave me the key. housekeeping couldnt speak english so i had to ask the front desk for our room to smell better. the cont breakfast were dried out donuts. needless to say we went to the double t for all but one breakfast. no mgmt ever helped me out with our problems or would give in on some reimbursement. i did write a letter after we returned and got a letter back thanking me for my comments and now they knew some things needed improved on. i wont stay there again. planning another trip in oct and will be staying at the comfort inn next door,not happy
"Great location, great service. Really all you could ask for in hotel. We stayed on the Gold level and really enjoyed our stay. We were in Boston during a major snow storm, so the location across from the mall entrance (Westin) was really convenient. We've stayed at the Fairmont in Boston many times and it continues to please.",happy
"It is fantastically close to Union Square so as far as location, we couldn't ask for anymore.
The front desk weren't particularly helpful to issues that arose during our stay. This was a multiple stop holiday and every other hotel we booked, successfully put us in our requested separate beds. The Handlery tried to put us in a double and were not happy when we requested what we had booked. The bellboys were very helpful.
The rooms are small and contain the minimum.",not happy
"Staying at this hotel we enjoyed a relaxing and comfortable end to a less than great day. We had airline delays that made our original hotel plans impossible. I made the reservation for the Holiday Inn at the airport during our layover. We were warmly greeted and found our room clean, comfortable and relaxing. We enjoyed the Sleep Number bed in the room; very comfortable. They run a convenient airport shuttle to the hotel. 
The hotel restaurant has a nice menu and a daily special. We both ordered the salmon and found it cooked to perfection. The breakfast buffet was good and has convenient hours. 
We will stay there again.",happy
"i thoroughly enjoyed my room at extended stay, the staff were extremely polite and helpful. what really got me was that every morning, there was fresh coffee alongside bagels and muffins just waiting for guests in the lobby. my only grievance is that they do not have kat - cables-ethernet cables for there guests. Me, having stayed at extended stays before, was expecting them too. i brought my x-box along and thank goodness i brought a wireless adapter because it would be useless, plus the fact that when i first plugged in my laptop i realized why... they want to charge extra for a highspeed connection!!! i was thoroughly disappointed. the other extended stays all have been able to provide me with ethernet cords so far for free without trying to get extra money. that majorly disappointed me. sry extended but you need to change that. id rather pay --$ more to stay somewhere that can provide me an ethernet cord and not try to rip me off $- dollars a day for highspeed WIRELESS internet, what a joke. wireless only gets so fast. other than that the features and ammenities where great and the staff friendly and helpful.",happy
"After reading various negative reviews of The New Yorker, I was very tempted to cancel the hotel, and search for another one, I was pleased that I didn't. The taxi fare to the hotel from JFK is a fixed rate of $-- plus approx $- for the toll. Check in was quick and straight forward...staff weren't very smiley, but I wasn't planning to hang around for a chat. Security at the hotel is great, guests need to show their room key to get past. I was allocated a room on the --nd floor, there are plenty of lifts. The room was a double-double, side view, a double-double room does make the room appear a bit smaller, but it's not too bad. The room was very clean, bathroom was clean, and more than enough towels are supplied. The hairdrier is quite powerful, there is only one negative thing I can think of, and that is that the shower isn't powerful, but again it's bearable. Shampoo and Body Gel bottles are supplied and replaced if necessary.
Location: the location of the hotel is fantastic...minutes walk to Macys, and The Empire State Building, come out of the hotel, turn right and than left at the traffic lights...walk for a couple of mins and you're at Macy's. 
Tick Tock Dinner is to the right of the hotel as you're walking out, nice place, we had a $- tip added on at the end of the bill. Another great restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner is The Stage Door, again to the right of the hotel, cross the road. Great menu and reasonable prices, good service.
I would also recommend a cafe on --- Eighth Avenue, cheap, and the food is very fresh and prepared in front of you. Come out of the hotel, cross the road, turn left and walk for about --- mins.
The hotel does not charge to the room. 
The hotel bar is pricey!!!!!!!! But does play good --'s music.
Check out - it might be worth checking with the company you've booked the hotel with to see if the price you're paying includes local taxes. Our final bill had a total of --% added per night on top of our bill. If you have time to kill before your flight, you can leave your luggage with the hotel for a charge of --c per case-bag, and the same charge when collecting your case-bag. The hotel taxi to the airport is around $--, would recommend pulling a taxi off the street for the flat rate of $--.
Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",happy
"We stayed in the tower, less expensive, and the room was a very nice Hilton type room. If you stay in the tower, book early and ask for a room overlooking the grounds and the bay, as opposed to the interstate. Very nice pool area and being right on the bay is a definite plus. Restaurant much better than I expected at a Hilton. Great location, easy to get anywhere as long as you have a car, which is pretty much a necessity in San Diego. Not certain that I'd choose to stay there again, but I might.",happy
"The reception area is beautiful and the entrance to the property is very nice. Our room was a let down. We had a - queen suite. It was on the main floor close to the adult pool area. Our window looked straight at the lounging area and the loungers looked straight at us. There was a rowdy crowd in the evening-night that shut down when a small child asked them to around --pm. The location of our room was very poor.
When we entered our room it was stuffy. We promptly turned on the A-C but it remained stuffy for our two day stay. I was sure there would be mould under the dry wall. There was wireless internet in the lobby for --.-- a day and dial up in the room for the same price. Despite being registered as - adults and - children, we had only - towels and not extra sheets for the pull out. I would choose a diffierent hotel for future stays in Phoenix.",not happy

"We had a lovely suite with a great location to all the tourist areas. We had already checked out the day the blackout occurred and were scheduled to take a night train home. Unfortunately the trains are electric and couldn't get into New York! The staff at the Wyndham were great. They checked us back in and gave us a room with a view, helped us find out about Amtrak, etc. As it turned out the next AM there were still no trains South (and by now a lot of people had been flying into Logan because NYC was closed) but we did find out trains were running out of Manhattan South (we needed to get the Wilmington, Delaware). It was like the Amazing Race! Everyone trying to get out of town. We ended up taking a Greyhound to NYC and were able to get a train home. It cost us about an additional $---- but it could have been worse. Only down side was the staff didn't know much about the package deal I booked which was supposed to include nightly popcorn and sodas for the kids. ALso I was charged $--.-- for a - min phone call home (I stupidly left my calling card at home). I would recommend this Hotel to anyone!",happy
"As a Starwood platinum member I have stayed at this hotel about -- times over the past - years for business trips. I have always found the rooms clean and quiet, beds very comfortable and service attentive but not overbearing. Check in is always fast and the staff is always friendly and efficient. The colors of the lobby and rooms are very neutral but relaxing after a long days work. The bathrooms are clean and modern with great shower heads. The fitness facility is very nice with a good variety of equipment. It is a large space so you do not feel like the gym was a afterthought. The restaurant and bar are on the second floor and I have eaten here often instead of going out for dinner. Food is fresh and very good, eating at the bar is welcome and a good experience if you are a solo diner. If you are a loyal Starwood customer you will find this DC hotel vastly better than the experience at the DC Four Points, and not nearly as expensive as the W and St. Regis. Rates vary greatly depending on the season and the convention schedule. Highly recommend for business travelers.",happy

"I was very pleased with what we received for what we paid. The gentleman, Christopher, at the counter was very helpful. We did run into a flaw of not having a room with a frig and micro, but he rectified it immediately. He told me when remodeling is complete they will all have these items. The room was clean. The pool was large and the kids loved it. My husband was thrilled with the fact that an affordable motel had a fitness center. I spent a majority of time on the computer in the complimentary business center, set up in the lobby. I was able to continue to book and plan the rest of our road trip through the use of their computer. There was no additional charge for printing off the web pages. This was helpful. I would only ask them to change two things. First, you access everything from the outside, so they should not refer to themselves as a hotel, but rather a motel. Second, they should offer at least some type of complimentary breakfast, cookies, or something. Most hotels do in Austin and if they took the time to clean up the physical facility and their image, since it switched owners, it would be a final touch. Further more, I feel their extras at the price offered, put them above the other motels in their class. This should be incentive enough for budgeted travelers looking for a little more for their money. They should not trick the public by saying things like, """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hotel"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". That only sets some travelers up for disappointment. The same theory goes along with the breakfast, you offer so much in extras, that the first time traveler would expect """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""something"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in the way of food hospitality. I hope to revisit this hotel with my family, at which time I will update my review. Thank you for reading and please be an active part in helping travelers identify truly good secrets like this renovated motel-hotel, and avoid bad ones. Oh! one last tip, if you go with kids, look up Austin's Pizza Park. It is usually $--.-- but on Tuesdays and Fridays, I think it is $--.-- unlimited pizza, laser tag, video games, rock climbing, go carts, mini golf, bumper boats, my kids - to -- loved it!!!!",happy

"A pretty unique, or at least different hotel by Marriott Standards, in a very central location in mid town Manhattan. Walking distance to times square, madison av and -th av, but not on a super busy street itself which is nice. Recently redecorated by Marriott and now marketed as an Autograph Collection hotel. Its certainly no ordinary Marriott hotel, this is boutique style, good small cozy restaurant, trendy and cool bar and very personal well decorated rooms with a very engaging service.
General standard of the hotel - very good to excellent
Standard of the rooms - excellent (although quite small rooms)
Lobby - small but cozy and good for meeting colleagues - friends
Restaurant - small, cozy, good food and good service
Gym - excellent
Service - very good to excellent (especially the servicing of the rooms was top notch. Seems they have a separate lady taking care of each floor)
So, in conclusion, I would absolutely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a smaller, boutique style, high end hotel in midtown. Probably more a hotel for a weekend away with your partner or for business (at least the rooms I have seen are probably not for a trip with the kids). This hotel is in direct competition with The Chatwal (Starwood) which is also nearby.",happy
"Stayed here for onenight, it was a really clean hotel, room was a nice size considering it was in New York. Price was very good as well. It was in the center of times square, so lots to do and walking distance to -th avenue store, central park, and empire states bldg. It was my neice's --th birthday and marvin at the front desk was so nice. He sent up a birthday cake and some fruit. Restaruant row is on -th ave so that is not far at all. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Would definitley stay here again",happy
"Before we managed to escape from the Bahia hotel I managed to book the Omni hotel for $--- on priceline for the next - nights ( same price as Bahia --- times better). Checkin went very smooth , we got some input what room we wanted . Based on the reviews here I decided to get one away from the rail track.
This meant the back of the building with a view over Petco park, but unfortunately I could still see some of the rail track as we had a corner froom with - windows. The freight train did pass by a couple of times each night and it did not really bother us - and I am quite a light sleeper.
The location is perfect , --- m walk to the gaslamp quarter.
Parking can be done in the parking structure across the hotel for $ -- a night when there is a game on and less if there is no game. However it does not allow you to get your car in and out. This works well if you are out and about during the day and return in the afternoon in the hotel and then go out in the gaslamp quarter.
I thank the reviewer that mentioned to sign up for their Select Guest program. Do that online when you book the hotel, quote the number upon check in and enjoy complimentary fresh hot and cold beverage in the morning + a paper. You can buy bagels or crossaints to go with that and all of a sudden you have a cheap in-room breakfast.
If there is a game on you will have to wait until -- PM to get to sleep, but that is not a problem in this part of town.
The room was spacious and well laid out. Yes, the bathroom doors are still there, but you'll get used to that. 
Internet access for free with your laptop at a reasonable speed.
All in all, one of the better hotels we stayed in during our vacation in SW USA.",happy
"I must agree with the previous reviewer. We had a poor experience at this hotel. We booked a Royal Court Double Double room. When we arrived after a long drive we were told that our room wasn't ready, even though it was after the check-in time, and that we should come back in an hour. When we did return and were waiting in the lobby I had to ask whether the room was ready, it was obviously too much for a member of staff to come over and inform me.
The room we booked was supposed to have views of either Nob Hill or Union Square - ours had neither. The room was very small and felt dated. When I complained to the front desk I was initially told that the hotel was full but the manager did manage to find a different room. This room was on a lower floor and had fewer amenities than the one we booked - although we were still charged the same price. It was a larger room but it still felt dated.
The beds were incredible uncomfortable. My wife and I shared one bed and my children shared the other bed. Not one of us had a good night's sleep while we were there (three nights). When I raised this issue I was just told it was tough! The staff were in the main surly and unhelpful.
I would not recommend this hotel.",not happy
"Check-in was a breeze. We had requested a king with no freeway view. Because of early check-in ONLY freeway view was available. It wasn't too loud overnight - a semi's horn woke me up around -am but that was it. The room we were in (----) is one of - rooms behind an extra door - I suppose this helps reduce hallway noise but it possibly made the configuration of the bathroom very strange. The bathroom had - lights but unfortunately none were right near the shower so the shower area was a little dark. The tub basin looked super old and there was a ---"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" old black spot on it - gross! As far as the room, the TV was quite possibly one of the smallest I've ever seen in a hotel. Definintely under --"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". The bed was very strange - it was some type of ergonomic bed but we found it very hard, lumpy and ungiving. Hotel is super convenient to -th St. I knew in advance about $---night parking and chose to park for free on the street in a meter spot instead. They are free until -:--am so we just woke up a little early to put some change in. There looked to be a $- lot right across the street, too.",not happy
"My husband had to stay in this hotel for -- nights, owing to a business trip. I joined him for the last - nights before we headed off touring. Despite having a high level Hilton Honors priviledge card, he got a very ordinary room, surprisingly small compared to say the average high end motel room, and was told nothing else was available, when he checked in. They gave him a few complimentary vouchers for the cheapest breakfast available on site, instead. When he got to the room, it had yet to be serviced. Two days later, he returned to his room mid morning to get some papers he had left inside by accident. The keycard would not work. He ran to reception where it was reissued. It still didn't work. Long story, short - - maintenance staff members and -- minutes later, he got access to the room. Of course, by now, he was extremely late for a meeting where he had to make a presentation. They gave him a $-- voucher for his inconvenience!!!!! The room was very tired - furniture scuffed and old fashioned, drapes faded, paintwork scratched, bathroom fixtures scoured until the base metal was exposed, that kind of thing. The desk was too small to do any work on and use a PC at the same time, it had an old-fashioned TV with a poor screen. Worse, the airconditioning was extremely noisy and the thermostat very insensitive. It turns itself off for long periods, then the fan comes on at maximum warp to cool the room down in a hurry, then runs a little more quietly before shutting off. This cycle is not conducive to a peaceful night's sleep.
My first day, arriving jet-lagged from the UK, they had a water problem. I ended up having a cold shower in the morning, but there was NO water by --.-- am. Guests were told they could use the facilities in the spa building, - minutes walk away. While the water was off, housekeeping 'did' the room. How you can clean a bathroom properly and hygienically without water, nobody ever managed to explain to my satisfaction. Further, there was evidence of remedial repair works going on around the accommodation blocks, and the nearest elevator to the room was out of order for the whole of my husband's -- night stay.
This hotel has a large pool and water activity based leisure facility. This is ideal for families with children and people wanting to relax and sunbathe. If you spend most of your time here, you will probably consider the property not bad. If you mostly just use the rooms, you are unlikely to be impressed. The best feature, to me, was a reasonably comfortable bed.
While the front of house staff were polite and embarrassed at the shortcomings, and claimed they wanted to help with the problems we encountered, they didn't actually achieve much or offer anything positive or genuinely meaningful to alieviate the situation. The other staff members we encountered - housekeeping and ground staff - seemingly spoke little or no english and just put on a smile because they had been trained to do so. 
Not our usual Hilton experience.",not happy
"The bed was the best. Super comfortable and large. The room was extra large too with plenty of space to move around even with our - suitcases spread far and wide. The shower was lovely. No bathtub, but with a shower this nice, we never missed a tub. Had all the amenities we needed and they were nice quality as well. I almost never think there are adequate blankets on the bed but there were here. And the breakfast was much more than we hoped for by the description of 'continental breakfast'. There was an omelet station where you could choose from fresh ingredients and have it made to order, plus biscuits and gravy, waffles, tons of fresh fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese, and all the other cereals, muffins and pastries you would normally expect. The only downfalls were some cosmetic repairs that needed attention, both in the halls and our room, and the tv really needed updating. We had a remote held together by tape that only worked some of the time. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would have a hard time finding anything even half as nice for the price.",happy

"My husband and I stayed here two nights on our last two nights of our Western vacation. It is close to the airport and has great views of the marina and waterfront. The room was large and I'm not sure whether it had been recently updated or was in the process of being updated (decor not to my liking-done in browns and oranges). The bathroom was large. We were in a non smoking room, but I think it smelled heavily of cigarette smoke-maybe chemical cleaner-not pleasant. The staff was friendly.",not happy
"This has been the place that I keep returning to when I travel to New York.
Once again I reserved the one bedroom suite. It is bright and comfortable and lovely to return to after a day out exploring the city. The bathroom had lovely linen and has a great shower.
The staff were excellent and offered us advice on local restaurants that we visited and thoroughly enjoyed.
The location is also part of the reason for returning. There is the subway on the corner and plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. The High Line is not far away and certainly a nice place to stroll.
The stairs seem to be getting steeper or perhaps I am getting older! It is great to know that when you finish the climb that you have your own haven in bustling NYC.
Chelsea Pines Inn remains at the top of my list for places to stay in NYC.",happy
"Stayed here last night on business. Nice atmosphere for a business traveler. Valet parking is a bit expensive but terrific service. Front desk very efficient. Room was clean, comfortable but a bit stale. A typical Embassy Suites product but all good. (By the way: Embassy Suites has ALWAYS had the worst hotel pillow in the industry. That hasn't changed.). Best part do this experience was the breakfast offering. Fresh, made to order and lots of options. I would recommend this hotel to business, leisure or convention travelers.",happy
"The initial impression of this hotel was fantastic. Gorgeous lobby, location centered exactly between the two planned activities over the weekend, and a unique room set up. Two bathrooms was a plesant bonus.
HOWEVER....
The air conditioner-heat didn't work and soaked the floor. Housekeeping didn't thoroughly clean the room. The Keurig had two used pods in it. The garbage had someone else's smelly socks in it. Don't want to think of what else might not have been cleaned. The staff was less than helpful and didn't apologize when issues were brought to their attention. No one offered assistance with the luggage. Valet told me it would be ten minutes to get my car. I gave them more than twenty and they still hadn't gotten my car. Overall the location of this hotel should place it in high demand but the staff, cleanliness, and overall experience are disappointing. The only low point to my entire trip to Boston was this hotel. Didn't bother to try for any amenities as they were ridiculously overpriced. 
Also if you'll notice management's responses to all the complaints on this site are the same. They aren't focused on the actual complaints. They are a copy and paste job. I've emailed the hotel directly with my complaints. We'll see what they say.",not happy

"Our trip to visit Washington, DC was from ---- to -----. We stayed in a deluxe King nonsmoking room at the Omni Shoreham that was located in the West wing on the seventh floor. We had a view to the back of the hotel over the pool. I had found a special for $--- a night through Travelzoo and booked directly with the hotel. The room was not large, but was comfortable enough. The rack rate on the door was $---. A small fridge was in the TV cabinet with drawers was convenient. Beds were great. The bathroom was compact but there was a short shelf under the sink to use and a shelf over the toilet. Tub had a short shelf on the back and had a curved shower rail so it was fine; nice showerhead. TV reception would be great and then go snowy at times. The small walk-in closet did not have a light so I made good use of the flashlight I packed. Good size safe in the closet for my small laptop and small purse. Glass knobs on bath and closet door, and a full-size mirror on the closet door but we usually had it open. I had to ask the housekeeper for robes and a foam pillow the second morning of our stay, and she had this for us when we returned to our room later. Being a Select Guest was wonderful with coffee and hot tea every morning, and we opted for a bagel or English muffin ($-.-- each) that kept us going until lunch later in the day; a few times napkins-silverware was not provided and on two mornings the bagels were old, tough and rock hard (only complaint we really had). One day we ordered some snacks in the evening, and room service brought them to us on a table in the room so we felt special. We had a few desserts from Morsels we had bought downstairs. Internet signal was weak and an Ethernet bridge was provided, I ended up using my data card I have which was faster. We ate at Robert's in the hotel once for dinner and it was very good. Staff and service was excellent from the bellmen, check-in-front desk, concierge, maid, room service, and engineers. Staff responded promptly to concerns or questions when contacted. The hotel lobby is grand, the roses changed several times during the week, and the lobby floor shines immaculately – definitely impressive! Our room was very clean. The bath rug was removed and missing a few days, so we asked for another one. We spilled coffee one day on the carpet by the bed and the next day asked housekeeping to clean, which they did while we were gone during the day and you could never tell it was stained or even damp. We were favorably impressed by staff at this hotel, and believed it was four diamond quality. It cost us $-- plus tip to get to the hotel via cab from National airport (you have to get in line to obtain a cab which can be confusing), and $-- plus tip back from the Omni through Abe's sedan and shuttle service the concierge booked for my husband and I with luggage. We were aware of the loud air conditioner and heavy noisy doors from prior Trip Advisor reviews so that was no surprise. We experienced slow elevators once during our two week trip. Many times during our stay the hotel was extra busy with different conventions going on. Everything was still handled quickly which impressed us, despite the number of guests we saw in the lobby and hallways. We loved the hotel and if returning to Washington, DC area would definitely stay here again at the Omni Shoreham. We heard some stories from other people we met during our trip about other places they stayed which were more expensive and poor quality in comparison. 
The metro is close by and convenient to the Omni. We purchased Smart Trip cards ($- each) at Metro Central (about three stops from Woodley Park so it costs $-.-- to get there) and I put on $-- for my card and $-- for my husband's card (he is a senior so his fare rates were half price). We still had some money left on the cards after two weeks. You can go to the website metroopensdoors.com to get directions from Woodley Park to wherever you want to go which is convenient. The Smart Trip cards also get you on some local area buses, including the DC Circulator that we used to get to Georgetown. 
We did the Grayline Double Decker (hop on and hop off) tour bus that stops across the street from the hotel – you have two days to use your ticket and we LOVED this bus tour! Excellent and highly recommend it. We liked it so much we did a six-hour tour on another day with Grayline to go see Mt. Vernon (go to Union Station before - AM to buy your ticket and board). 
Our first 'tour' vendor we had tried on our second night was through Royal Trolley to see the monuments in the moonlight - it was a big disappointment as not enough folks to run the trolley so they put six of us in a van; another couple who had done this type of tour in the past with other vendors said it was 'okay' but not great like they had experienced before. I would recommend using another vendor if you want to see the monuments at night – and consider one with a guide that stays with you to explain things as we sometimes did not know where to go after stopping to get out as this was our first time in Washington, DC. 
Places we would not recommend or go back to eat in the neighborhood: We tried the Lebanese Taverna on Connecticut one night, but were disappointed except for the few lamb kabob pieces and bread that were good – neither my husband or I would recommend going there and it was around $---person. We tried the Café Paridiso on Connecticut Ave. the first evening we arrived that others had mentioned on TripAdvisor but were disappointed and would not return. 
Favorite places to eat in the neighborhood close to the hotel - Open City Café across on Calvert Street. Petits Plats around the block on Connecticut Ave. is excellent – we ate there our last night; order the 'floating island' for dessert. Petits Plats also has rotisserie chicken you can order for take out too we found out. We ordered Chinese take-out once (lunch specials and soup) from the Eddie Cafe across on Calvert (but address says Connecticut Ave) and were favorably impressed and recommend. Chipolte's is on Calvert across the street too - good Mexican food and guacamole-chips for a reasonable price - we ate there several times. We had McDonald's a time or two that is on Connecticut just to keep our meal budget in line and they were surprisingly good too (they are downstairs which is different and we would take our meal or hot fudge sundaes back to the hotel). The CVS pharmacy on Connecticut has cookies, chips, sodas and water and is convenient about a block or so away from the hotel. We bought items and sundries quite a few times at CVS which is conveniently located. A dry cleaner is next door but we brought enough clothes for our entire trip; if you were there on business it might be handy to know it is nearby, however. 
There is a place in DuPont circle that says they have the 'best' cupcakes in a window when you walk by and you go downstairs – we bought four and the red velvet one was terrific with cream cheese frosting! If you spot this little bakery shop for cupcakes, be sure to stop! It is not far from the Grayline Hop-on, hop-off Double Decker tour bus stop in DuPont Circle. 
Our favorite place to eat in Washington DC that we highly recommend (worth the trip) is the Old Ebbitt Grill (a historic landmark since ----) at --- --th St. near the White House in Washington – we were there for lunch twice and breakfast once – excellent food, good prices, and amazing atmosphere whether inside or in the patio area. We also ate at Fago de Chao at ---- Pennsylvania Ave. (near the Old Post Office Tower); it is a Brazilian steakhouse that is pricey but great service and good food – a treat but will run you $---person plus tax and tip. We ate once at McCormick & Schmidt on F Street in Washington which was very good. We ate lunch once at Ella's Wood Fired Pizza which was good. The Chart House in Alexandria was enjoyable with great food. We also liked the buffet at the Garden Café in the National Gallery of Art at -th and Constitution N.W. which filled us up for the afternoon activities. 
One of the best maps we used was 'Washington: The Nation's Capital' that you can obtain from the Park Service at the White House Visitor's Center. We took several with us, had some others, but wore this map ragged until it fell apart as it became our favorite to get around, and we went back to get more. 
The International Spy Museum is great and worth the price to visit. Be sure to see the FD Roosevelt memorial too on the tidal basin (between the Jefferson and Lincoln memorials). If you want some good bargains, ladies will enjoy Filene's Basement to shop. We explored Alexandria, and Georgetown (check out the canals there in Georgetown) as well as Washington, DC. We even visited the zoo which is free the first day we were there and got to see the Orangutans go across the 'O line' which was amazing. Check with your representative a few months ahead of time to book a White House tour, the Library of Congress (amazing), and the Bureau of Engraving. The Omni Shoreham is a quality hotel to experience, and an excellent base to explore Washington, DC and the surrounding area. A wonderful and memorable trip for us – the fall leaves made it even more spectacular!",happy

"Stayed here right before the hurricane hit with our two kids. Had a very nice one bedroom suite that worked well for all of us. The room was nice and spacious and had floor to ceiling windows that looked out over lower Manhattan and the Hudson. There is a subway station right across the street and two others for different lines within blocks. Absolutely ideal for getting around. Plus, a walk down Spring St. and you are right in the heart of SoHo. We had the breakfast package and the buffet was small, but had everything you needed and was nicely done. We never did get around to checking out the pool so I don't know what it was like.
The service was top notch at check-in and they were very accommodating when we had to check out early because of the weather. The hotel was also very welcoming to kids, with complimentary warm milk brought up at night and our sofa bed made daily. 
The only downsides, and they are minor, is that there is no free wifi, which drives me crazy, and the bathroom was not very private. The toilet area is surrounded by frosted glass and is essentially open to the rest of the room as there is no door on the bathroom. I know this design trend was popular for awhile, but I hate it. Other than that, great stay and we would return.",happy

"I travel a lot for work but I've never written a review like this before. The reason I'm writing this review is to share with everyone the fantastic and honest staff of the Sheraton Dallas Hotel by the Galleria. I specifically would like to highlight Mahom. I accidentally left my beloved David Yurman ring (a college graduation present from my parents) on the sink in the lobby bathroom. I then left the hotel and got in a cab to the airport. Mahom found my ring in the bathroom and instead of keeping it she kindly, honestly and thoughtfully set it aside in the hotel office for someone to claim. As I was pulling in at the airport I realized I didn't have the ring and called the hotel. Mahom answered and told me she had found it and it was there waiting for me. The cab driver turned around and took me back to retrieve it. I cannot thank Mahom enough for reunited me with this very sentimental and valuable piece of jewelry. I would have been heartbroken to have lost it and I cannot thank Mahom enough. Mahom and the rest of the Sheraton Dallas Hotel staff are a fantastic group of people and I highly recommend the hotel to anyone staying in North Dallas. Thank you again, Mahom, and I will certainly stay at the Sheraton on my next Dallas trip.",happy

"El Tropicana was a nice hotel. We stayed there for - nights. They did a beautiful job on remodeling the lobby. Quite sparkly! I saved around $---.-- by staying at the end of the Riverwalk. Everyone I met was very friendly and quite helpful. El Tropicana is at the end of the Riverwalk right now although they are expanding the Riverwalk past the hotel currently. I dont know if our room was remodeled, but it was neat and clean, the only problem was the toilet flushed slowly. We did have to get a King suite because we needed to have a refrigerator in the room, my friend takes insulin. You can walk right across the street from the hotel and down some stairs and you are on the Riverwalk, but the heart of the Riverwalk is about a ----- minute walk from there. We took the trolley to the Riverwalk a lot, the trolley picks you up from the front door of the hotel, or you can also walk across the street and pick up the River Taxi. It will drop you off anywhere you want along the Riverwalk and brings you back but stops at - or -- pm so plan accordingly. We did not rent a car when we were there, the public transportation was all we needed for this trip. The hotel also has - toucans, a tortoise, and a bearded dragon in a glass enclosed area.

Check in was a pleasant process as they seemed genuinely happy that we were staying there. The hotel provided us with a kind note congratulating us on our anniversary and welcoming us to the hotel. 
We made our way up to the --th floor (---- was the suite number) and were in (pleasant) disbelief when we walked into the room. I tried to take as many pictures as I could, so it might be easier to look at those rather than me going into detail about each room. A couple of things to point out though is that there is a full kitchen and a pool table, and the balcony is HUGE and overlooks downtown. If I remember correctly, when I made the reservation they stated that this is the only room that is modern. The other rooms are very traditional (but still gorgeous!). 
We ate dinner at the French Room and weren't disappointed. The service was spectacular and the food was exquisite. I also highly recommend the Rodeo Bar for a lighter meal. Fun atmosphere and very reasonably priced food. 
All in all, this is a wonderful hotel that I would recommend over and over again. Do not hesitate to stay here :)",happy

Made so much noise we had to unplug it. While we were in a non-smoking room the hallway reeked of stale smoke. Dogs barking doors slaming.",not happy

"My wife and I spent - nights here in September. The overall impression is of tight spaces. The lobby is small and the room was small. It was a challenge closing the door to use the toilet. Also in order to see myself when I shaved I had to have my left shoulder partly in the hall outside the door (and I am a small guy). The room was small, but everything was new and the bed was quite nice. Really only room for one person to sit at the desk and a second person would have to sit on the bed to read, etc. While almost claustrophobic by American hotel standards, the room was in line with many we have stayed at in Europe. In fact most of the clientele seemed to be from outside the US based on the wide range of accents heard in the lobby. The room rates were quite good for a hotel in NYC. The discounted parking rate at the garage - block over was also excellent for NYC.
The location is pretty good. You have to walk over - avenue and down - blocks to catch one group of subway lines (metro, underground), and - avenues over and - blocks down to catch another group of subway lines. You are about a block away from -th Ave and a bit closer to Broadway (not shows the street). There are coffee and tea shops nearby and quite a concentration of US southern-style barbeque restaurants nearby. 
In summary although we “paid for our stay using our hotel points, the rates were good for NYC, but the room and bathroom were small by US standards and the hotel is pretty close (----- min walk) to subway lines. So if you don’t mind being cozy and want to save money in the big apple this place is fine.",not happy
"We have been coming to this hotel for years, as a stayover for flights leaving and returning to Seattle airport, and over the years, the facility has seemed in worse and worse shape. It is always something, now, be it the towel hook is falling off the bathroom door, the shower curtain bar is drooping, the toilet flush a little lame, or the hot water a little unpredictable. The staff have always been, and remain, fantastic, which is why we keep coming back. But I think it has reached the point now that we are going to look for somewhere else to lay over before and after flights.",not happy
"Would not recommend at all. The agent at the front desk was dressed very sloppy and not friendly at all. I would give you her name but for the two days that I was there, she never wore a name tag. Upon entering my room, it had a really old smell to it, the tub had black grit or something on the inside, the toilet only half way worked and one of my phones did not work. 
This hotel is definately not for the business traveler. If you need to use your laptop, your best bet is to have a wireless card because the hotel will not provide an ethernet cable. Otherwise you will have to plug into the phone for dial up and because the phone only has one line, when you are using the internet, you cannot call out and people cannot call in. 
I am done, but would definately not stay here again!!",not happy
"Stayed at the Sheraton from ----- to -----. Had reserved a room in the East Tower, King Bed, High Floor, but when we arrived, there were none available. They put us in a room near the pool, in neither of the towers. Looks like it used to be an old motel that the Sheraton had bought out. The room was cozy, but still, it wasn't what we had reserved. We were told that our stuff would be moved the next day to the room that we had reserved. Came back to the front desk around -:--pm the next day, they had no idea what we were talking about. Had to wait another -.- hours for them to get us our room. Again-- nothing was wrong with the first room, it's just not what we had reserved. The second room, on the -th floor of the East tower was just as nice, furnished the same as the first one, but had a slightly bigger bathroom and a great view of the marina.
This hotel is very isolated, and you won't find a cab ride for less than $-- one way. Even if they charge you for parking, I think that you'll save money to rent a car.
The bar is pretty pricy, as is the restaurant, but the quality of both are good.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel, but if we visit San Diego again, will probably stay within walking distance to the trolly.",happy
"I took my -- year-old daughter on a special long weekend trip. I wanted to stay in Manhattan, but all the other hotels in this price range had shared bathrooms and were in much older buildings. This brand-new. hotel was beautiful, with helpful staff and a great location. It was less than a - minute walk to at least - subway lines, which made getting uptown super easy. And less than - minutes to Battery Park. The rooms are a touch small, but sparkling clean and well suited, with comfy chairs for end-of-the-day lounging. There is free wifi and computers and printers in the lobby as well. There is a top-floor restaurant and sun terrace, which we only discovered on our last night - too bad, as we would have spent our evenings up there! The only drawback is that it's right behind the World Trade Center reconstructions and one morning we heard the machinery very early. I will stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat and highly recommend it.",happy
"Rooms- cramped, dirty
Carpet- left unvaccumed, stained
Breakfast- very few choices
Service during breakfast- supposedly Club Lounge guest as what I paid for but receptionist named Jessica very rude and had to literally tell her to give us Club Lounge table since she refuses
Hors D' Oeuvers- dehydrated vegetables, very limited in quantity, no drinks
Pool- cloudy pool, murky
Parking- worst spiral driveway and expensive for $---day
Extras: airconditioner not cooling enough. Called engineering -x only to be told there's nothing they can do",not happy
"The location of this hotel is very good. It is located on Lombard Street, very conenient when moving by car. Besides, the hotel has its own parking.
After a - minute walk, on Street, there are many restaurants and bars that open until late at night.
The room was large and confortable. 
The breakfast was not very good. It was very basic, self-service, and you have to take it to your room.
The hotel staff was not very friendly.",not happy
Just spent - nights at the hotel and was just as good as it was -years ago. They have the best gym and I'm particular. Also getting a late check out was no problem. Staff was top notch and the helped for what ever I needed. I travel a lot and always stay at - to - star hotels and this was as good as I could hope for. I will be using the hotel again in May.,happy
"As a frequent Hilton guest and as a Hilton Honors Gold member, I expected more from the stay, but was satisfied for the value overall. The front desk check-in didn't seem especially welcoming and neglected our HH membership perks (when we realized this later, I went down to the front desk and although it was too late for a room upgrade, we were given the breakfast vouchers and instructions for free wifi). The renovated rooms are pretty nice, but there seems to be some lack of attention to detail (i.e. mess of tangled wires clearly visible behind the desk). We would have appreciated a mini-fridge to keep some cool drinks on hand, but had to settle for the ice bucket instead. We ordered room service for a late lunch but was very disappointed in the quality of the meal they brought up (service was fast however). The big open lobby made for a nice entrance, but took away any real sense of atmosphere from the sectioned off breakfast area. We couldn't find any good restaurants in the surrounding neighborhood (and most of the casual dining places seemed a bit sketchy), but the hotel location was good for our night layover - we had been renting a car while in Texas, so we stayed at the Hilton (good parking area) and took the back road to the airport the next morning (avoided the highway completely).",not happy
"We just got back from staying at this Embassy Suites in Austin. The parking was as others described, basically free. We even told the front desk people that we had a car and weren't charged for the parking. The front desk people were actually the most negative part (of an overall good stay). It took a long time to check in and they didn't have a room ready for us at -:-- PM. With such a large hotel that seemed unbelievable. Anyway, they got us a room soon afterwards and once we got into the room it was great. Very large and very quiet. We could have slept all day with the nice black-out curtains. The breakfast was extremely nice, if a bit disorganized. They seemed to run out of things quite a bit and then restock them. There were large surges of people running around grabbing food and I was overwhelmed so early in the morning.
My boyfriend used the exercise room and said it was very nice. We also hit the pool and hottub, which were both better than I expected (based on the other reviews). The late hours (open until midnight) were especially nice. They also have free internet in the business center.
All in all I would go back. The location near Town Lake and South Congress was ideal. We were close to downtown, the university and both highways.",happy
The service at this Holiday Inn was great. We would certainly stay there again if in Seattle.,not happy
In town for a large event and was looking forward to a four night stay that turned into what's going to be wrong next. - months advance reservation and couldn't get the bed we reserved and confirmed. Trash and dirty glasses left outside our room on the floor. Dirty glasses were left in the room and they didn't even empty out the ice bucket or clean under and around it. I felt the breakfast buffet was misrepresented. The hotel was clean and it looks nice.,not happy

"This was a last minute booking so I did not have the luxury of reading reviews. I was looking for a hotel close the inner harbor with free parking. The elevator panel appeared vandalized; so did the guest room doors – even the security latch and regular lock, and the door did not close securely. That coupled with the exterior stairwells and hallways added a layer of insecurity since they give ANYone immediate mischievous access to all guest rooms via the doors and windows. I """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""slept"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" that night with the tv and light on, and the table and chairs jammed against the door for added personal security - and I was out at first light.

"As first time visitors to NYC we were overwhelmed by the choice of hotels but chose the Shelburne as a result of positive reviews here. We were not disappointed. Location is ideal (- mins walk to Grand Central for the subway), about - mins to the Empire State Building and --St shopping, -- mins to Time Square. Despite good location our room remained quiet and we were undisturbed by traffic, etc. Booked through Expedia we were upgraded on arrival to a --th floor room with - Queen beds. Room was quite large and had small kitchen area with microwave and fridge. Bathroom was small but adequate. Room was clean, the decor was a little """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""tired"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but that was not a problem. The hotel is surrounded by eating opportunites - the Rare burger restaurant downstairs was excellent, and the small Indian restaurant across the road towards Grand Central serves outstanding food from modest surroundings. There are - small supermarkets within --- yards, a wine shop, and an Irish pub which shows Premiership football for the homesick!
The staff were very helpful in arranging a shuttle bus back to Newark Airport (book --h before departure) and the doormen deserve a mention for being outstandingly friendly and helpful.
Nice hotel, nice people, not in your face but there for helpful advice when you need it. 
Tip for -st time visitors - take the hop on hop off tour bus - day ticket, including Statue of Liberty trip and Empire State building admisssion.",happy
"We just returned from a - night stay here while visiting family and friends in Houston. We had stayed at this hotel many years ago when it was the Ritz Carlton, and were very impressed by the current staff and hotel. The location is ideal - centrally located and close to the major highways, restaurants, and shopping in Houston, but tucked into a nice, quiet neighborhood. We are a younger couple and have on occasion received slightly condescending service at luxury hotels in the past, but the staff here was warm, friendly, and extremely professional. We will definitely stay here for our future visits to Houston.",happy
"We had a great experience at Ameritania Hotel. I was celebrating --th birthday. The staff was very accommodating, especially the Concierge Renaldo Moore.

I appreciate your entire staff and want to send out a big thanks to everyone. See you next time!",happy
"We had a king loft room, fantastic - and the bathroom is out of this world a -ft round bath tube with rain shower and shower attachment - it was huge! Oversized bedroom for NY standards and in the winter there was even an open fire that you could have lit.
Staff were often lacking in their presence, I guess part of the hotels charm, and so it felt you were in more of an exclusive club rather than hotel. The public areas are very funky, and at nights very dark so you had to let your eyes adjust to the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""mood"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" lighting. Bar staff great (but prices are high), as soon as you asked for anything it just appeared.
Location is great on West --th and -th, -- blocks from the Empire State Building, - minutes to Times Square and handy for subway and Penn Station to get to Newark Airport. 
Concierge (only available weekdays - shame) was fantastic and she knew all the hints and tips - she directed us to TKTS down in South Port Plaza and we got some excellent tickets for half price to see Mary Poppins and Mamma Mia! Had some great tips for inexpensive places to eat too.
Downside - the elevators, there are three of them, but they aren't that reliable. We got trapped in one for over two hours, and when finally we got out, no apologies from any of the staff or management. There seemed to be a lack of awareness as to how long we were trapped and no check to see if we were ok!! Perhaps thats the pretentiousness of the hotel?
In short if your looking for something hip and trendy, with prices to boot then you can't go wrong - this is not like a standard chain of Marriott or Hiltons, and made for a refreshing change",happy
"This hotel has a lovely lobby and an excellent location. The decor is nice and the Library Bar and Hudson Bar are both very welcoming. However, I was there for three nights and they put me in three rooms trying to find one that had a livable temperature. The first room started out at -- degrees and then they fixed it. After that it was -- degrees and would not get cooler. The heating-cooling unit blew hot air no matter what the thermostat was set to. The next room had a heating-cooling unit that would not work. If you turned it on the thing would make loud clanking noises all night. We left it off and they moved us to a new room the next day. That room was ----- degrees with the heat off. If you tried to turn the AC on, the air was luke warm and did nothing to cool the room. Also, this room was on the top floor and much larger. However, the water in the bathroom was rust colored each time you turned it on. It was a shame because the location was terrific and I really liked what they were going for in the space. You can find something more reliable if you look and, in the end, the concept was not worth the unreliable service and lack of comfort.",not happy
"My family and I stayed at Hotel Indigo over the Holidays, and I have to say we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay. We found the decor at the Hotel absolutely lovely; the color scheme used throughout the Hotel definitely puts one in a good mood, and the staff and management were always courteous and cheerful (big plus in my book). There is also plenty of parking (no charge) and the Hotel is walking distance from shopping and restaurants (Galleria). We stayed in a suite that had an amazing layout - the sitting room is separate from the bedroom, so it was nice to watch TV, while other family members enjoyed some privacy in the bedroom. We also liked the huge bathroom, which had some pretty fantastic Aveda products (A+), and we especially liked having an extra blanket in the sitting area, and a small mini fridge to store our drinks and snacks. We definitely would recommend this Hotel to others, it is in a perfect location for shopping and fun!",happy
"We picked this hotel because it earned four stars on Hotels. It would be four stars ... in Fallujah, perhaps or maybe Kabul. 
The first room they showed us had no lights. We would have had to dress by the light of the TV. There was a toilet sitting in the hallway and the whole floor had the atmosphere of a jail. 
When we complained, we got another room that had lights, but smelled like a moldy towl and had a torn and stained carpet. 
Even though we prepaid for our room, we left and stayed at a Holiday Inn several miles away. It cost us double, but it was worth it.",not happy
"We have stayed at the Whitehall numerous times. It has a perfect location for the Near North. Close to great restaurants, shopping, easy in and out. In fairness, the hotel is currently undergoing a much needed rehab. However, we were not notified of this when we made our reservations. The lobby bar and lounge is shut down, making the lobby basically non-existent. The air conditioning on the lower floor was not functioning. The staff, were obviously uncomfortable in the record breaking heat. Our room was on the --th floor, but it did not escape a coat of dust on all the furniture, presumably from the construction on the lower floor. We had to get new keys three times in four days, due to their not working. The in-room safe was broken, one of the phones was out of order, we needed to request another hair dryer as the one in the room did not function. Overall, the place is not what we had experienced in the past. We will stay there again, only if and when the renovation is complete.",not happy

"First and foremost, we got an amazing deal via hotels.com for about $--- a night for a --- sq ft, - room suite - THE LUXOUMBERG SUITE. I went to the Fairmont website to see what these rooms would have been if I booked direct and it was a whopping $--- a night. 
We were in the Main Building and I would have loved the views from the new tower, but what it lacked in views it made up in style, comfort and amenities. 
Just wandering the hotel, you get this great feeling of oppulance, history, and wealth. 
I heard some weird fact that every US President from FDR that has visited SF has always stayed in the Fairmont. I can certainly see why. The lobby is not trendy, or sexy, but it is grand and full of the finest marble. There must be -- different little couch areas to just to sit with a drink or wait for someone. 
Please promise me you will visit the in-house TONGA ROOM bar and restaurant, at least for a drink. It's quite a scene! Great place to have a Mai Tai before you head out. There is this feature where they make it rain and a band plays on a moving boat. I felt like I was really in Tahiti. (even though I had never been) Also worth a drink is the Top of the Mark Bar and Lounge right across the street in the Intercontinental hotel. One minute I had amazing views of all of SF, and the next minute we were encompassed in fog. 
Do like I did and sign up for the President's Club for free, before you check inn. It will get you free internet, gym usage, and a daily paper. You can do it at the Fairmont website. 
My only problem and it's not the hotels fault, is those darn hills! Some say it adds character to the city; I simply find it annoying. I'm -- and in decent shape and I was huffing and puffing when returning from a dinner of bar around the area. They are more like little mountains. I felt like I was a Sherpa at time's with my wifes bags from shopping. 
I was a little skeptical because I kept hearing this hotel was """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""old"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""outdated,"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but all areas we looked at, including our room, showed no signs of wear-and-tear. 
We had a late flight (--pm) and the bell desk was happy to hold our bags until about -pm. In fact, he also got us a Fairmont House Car - Luxury Sedan to take us to the airport, rather than a regular cab for the same price. 
Overall a great hotel. It seems to get an older crowd and it's not a W by any means, but it's not trying to be.

"We found this to be a great hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. The room was very spacious and quiet. both day and night. Love the free hot chocloate then free wine by the open fire before dinner. Great way to meet interesting people. That was in December so we don't kow what happens in other seasons
The hotel is situated down by the water pretty much at the end of wharf area which is a long way from the centre of the city. However, it is well serviced by the cable trams and the other street cars which regularly run close by and go back to the city . Get a - day pass for a modest sum and thats your transportation covered.",happy
"The Hotel is very impressive and the staff are extremely helpful. I booked a - x double bed room for myself and two adult size kids however only two pillows were supplied. The porter said he'd have one to us immediately but it never arrived (it was our first night after a long transatlantic journey and I was too tired to go looking). I left a message next day and another pillow was there when we returned to the room. The mini bar and table top """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""weight"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" controlled tray were very well stocked, too well stocked and a great temptation but prices were ridiculous - $--.-- for a bottle of water!!! Even if you pick something up and put it back you will be charged. I felt tea and coffee making facilities would have been an advantage but it seemed not a lot was """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""complimentary. Also the room was small enough for three adults. Having said that the staff in the hotel were extremely nice and very helpful, nothing was too much trouble. The room was spotlessly clean and the beds were turned down each night. I did feel they were small doubles though. Would I stay here again? If I became very rich and didn't have to budget then yes.",happy
"Had a lovely stay at the Iroquois recently! We asked for - double beded room and was upgraded to a suite! Service was second to none. Greeted by the lovely Bill and looked after by the even more lovely Nick! He was especially helpful and recommended some wonderful places to eat! The only downside was that the suite was actually a smoking room, which did smell initially, but you soon got used to it! The hotel itself, could do with a little updating and a duster wouldn't go a miss on the toilet lights! but thats just being picky! Complentary use of computer and printer was an excellent bonus, as was the free coffee in the morning! For a cheap and cheerful breakfast pop into the Red flame, just a few doors down! Also don't forget to tip EVERYBODY! We got told off on our return journey as we forgot to tip the door man!! A wonderful, fabulous time had by all! definately stay again!",happy
"We were visiting Boston for one night -- attending a Red Sox game - prior to spending our vacation on Cape Cod. Prior to booking our stay, we inquired about parking and was told parking was available at a garage next store. We booked our stay at the Buckmister as we thought a garage would be more secure than a surface lot. 
Our car was broken into and items taken sometime during the night. Both the garage and hotel disclaim any responsibility. The parking garages policy of closing one hour after the game basically means the employees go home at such time NOT that the lot is secured. In fact no gates are closed, security cameras are facing backwards -- it does not appear that the garage takes reasonable care in protecting the overnight cars.
The hotel claims that they simply reimburse the garage for the discount being given hotel guests and the hotel is not involved in the operation of the garage -- fair enough -- but it is very misleading for the hotel to represent that parking is nearby - when they know the parking is not secure overnight. They are a hotel -- they know the cars are going to be there overnight!
I would not recommend anyone stay at the Buckmister if they are traveling with a car.",not happy
"We stayed for one week at the Affinia Dumont hotel in NYC and were very happy. The room we had had a decent size, was always kept very clean by the room maid and you could not beat the location! It is about eight minutes walking distance to the Empire State Building and once you are there you are in the heart of Manhattan and it's up to your fantasy what you will do with the rest of your time. The possibilities are endless.
We did not try breakfast at the hotel nor any of the other amenities.
Checking in was fast, efficient and friendly service. One of the bell boys was very nice and helpful while another one should take some lessons from the first guy regarding service and friendliness towards the customer.
Also walking to Penn Station is quite doable. I walked there twice, it's super easy, down the street a few blocks and make one turn and voila. Takes about ----- minutes walking time.
All in all we liked it so much we are returning in the fall two more times and will stay there again.",happy

"This hotel was reasonably priced and in a good location. The room was clean and bed was comfortable. The breakfast buffet was quite good. 
My only big complaint was the service. I have never seen such terrible service in any hotel. I am not a weekly traveler, but I do travel ----- times per year. 
I was left on hold at the front desk for over -- minutes not once, but twice. This was just to ask a question. Getting the car took over -- minutes. Absolutely the worst of all of them were the bartenders and wait staff at the hotel restaurant-bar. It was like we were invisible. There were plenty of people working, but they were just standing around trying not to make eye contact. It was really hard to believe how bad the service was.
I should mention that I stayed at this hotel a year ago and didn't have these complaints about service. I don't know what has changed, but I won't stay there again.",not happy

The room was spacious and clean. It looked like it had been recently remodeled. The room was quiet. I was on the --th floor and there was no street noise. My only complaint would be the slow elevators. This was the only inconvenience during my stay. The location is outstanding. I went to three musicals during my stay and I was within -- minutes walking time of all the theaters. The staff was friendly and offered suggestions.
